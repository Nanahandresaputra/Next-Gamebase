      body: '<p>The release of a new Fire Emblem game is usually a big deal, so I was more than a little intrigued--but mostly confused--when I happened to glance at the Nintendo Today app calendar on September 24 and it said "Fire Emblem Shadows Available." There had just been a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-september-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7026/">Nintendo Direct on September 12</a>, after all, where Nintendo announced the next mainline entry in the series for Switch 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave-coming-to-switch-2-in-2026/1100-6534686/">Fire Emblem: Fortune\'s Weave</a>. There was no mention of Fire Emblem Shadows. And after playing it, I can see why Nintendo wouldn\'t showcase it on that big stage</p><p dir="ltr">I assumed it was referring to Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon, the 2009 remake of the first game in the series, and went on with my day. It was only later that evening I learned that Fire Emblem Shadows was actually a brand-new mobile entry in the series: one where players manage "real-time strategy and social deduction at the same time."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4578404-9957206684-FireE.png" data-ref-id="1300-4578404" data-ratio="0.56221889055472" data-width="1334" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1334px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4578404-9957206684-FireE.png" data-ref-id="1300-4578404"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4578404-9957206684-FireE.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4578404-9957206684-FireE.png 1334w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4578404-9957206684-FireE.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/43/434805/4578404-9957206684-FireE.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a></figure><p dir="ltr">The idea of a new game in the long-running tactics series arriving out of the blue had me eager to install it and see what it was about. I had a decent time with Fire Emblem Heroes, Nintendo\'s previous attempt at translating Fire Emblem to the world of free-to-play mobile games (and one that would go on to become <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fire-emblem-heroes-is-nintendos-first-mobile-game-to-hit-1-billion-in-revenue/1100-6505005/">Nintendo\'s first mobile game to hit $1 billion in revenue</a>). As such, I was curious to see how Shadows, which is also free to play, would differ. Unfortunately, the monkey paw soon curled, and I found myself dumbfounded by all the ways Fire Emblem Shadows is Fire Emblem in name only.</p><p dir="ltr">Fire Emblem Shadows\' premise is, at least on the surface, interesting. A twist on the standard franchise trope of a small band of warriors fleeing after the tragic fall of a noble kingdom, Fire Emblem Shadows instead asks, "What if that kingdom fell from within?" and has some of those in the protagonist\'s party (or even the protagonist themself) already corrupted and ready to betray their comrades.</p><p dir="ltr">How, exactly, that idea would work with Fire Emblem\'s tactical gameplay was the main question I had going into the experience, and the answer quickly became obvious: It doesn\'t. That\'s in large part because Fire Emblem Shadows isn\'t a tactics game. Instead, it\'s an auto-battler where you control a single character out of a team of three. Your character automatically moves and attacks enemies, as do your NPC or real-player teammates. The only real "gameplay" is selecting which spell out of a handful of options to use at any given time, dragging your chosen spell onto enemies or allies, and then waiting for your spells to reset (most spells share a cooldown) before using them again.</p><p dir="ltr">Battles are usually over quickly, and I rarely cast more than three or four spells during the course of a fight. There are single-target spells, area-of-effect spells that can damage foes as well as friends, and healing abilities. You can also navigate the battlefield of your own volition in a limited way, as certain spells can push or pull allies or enemies, or allow you to swap spaces with an adjacent unit. There\'s even an obligatory rock-paper-scissors "weapon triangle" fans of the franchise will be familiar with, where certain spells will deal more damage to enemies of an opposing type. That being said, battles feel like there is little to no strategy involved aside from hitting foes with spells they\'re weak against and occasionally healing. It\'s a feeling that largely stems from being unable to directly position your character--a key aspect of what makes Fire Emblem what it is as a series.</p><p dir="ltr">Where the real meat of Fire Emblem Shadows feels like it\'s supposed to be is in the previously mentioned "social deduction" aspects. During each match, one out of the three players is secretly an evil Shadow. Their goal is to try to take out their comrades while still looking innocent. After the first round a match, players are able to vote on who they think the traitor is. The second round then sees players face off against said traitor, who transforms into an evil corrupted version of their former self and is able to summon NPC minions to aid them in battle.</p><p dir="ltr">Guessing the traitor\'s identity in the previous round grants the non-Shadow players an extra life in the next, so it\'s not in the Shadow\'s best interest to throw subtlety out the window and just try to kill both good players in round one. Instead, Shadow players are encouraged to try to take out one player while sowing deception to gain an advantage in round two.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4578407-2519429156-FireE.png" data-ref-id="1300-4578407" data-ratio="0.56221889055472" data-width="1334" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1334px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.2%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4578407-2519429156-FireE.png" data-ref-id="1300-4578407"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4578407-2519429156-FireE.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4578407-2519429156-FireE.png 1334w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4578407-2519429156-FireE.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/43/434805/4578407-2519429156-FireE.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a></figure><p dir="ltr">It\'s a neat idea, but one that just doesn\'t work in practice. Because there are only three players per team, and one of them is you, it\'s always a 50/50 chance whether or not you are able to identify the Shadow. It\'s also fairly easy. If you see one player (or yourself) taking a lot of damage that isn\'t from enemy monsters while another player isn\'t, it\'s safe to assume the one that isn\'t being hurt is the Shadow. There is some trickery that can be done here to try to throw other players off the scent, such as healing teammates while also secretly hurting them or even the Shadow damaging themselves with their own abilities. Players can also cast spells after death with a longer cooldown, meaning the Shadow can still attack their comrades even if they are among the dead.</p><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, deception will only get you so far. No matter how clever you are as the Shadow, with so few options available in terms of players and gameplay systems, there\'s a strong chance you will get outed due to sheer probability. Matches feel too short to let the mind games truly kick in, and without any meaningful way to communicate or interact with other players outside of using spells in battle, voting is reduced to an extremely quick "this one or that one" screen. Not that it matters much. I\'ve won matches easily where I was outed as the traitor, and lost matches in the second round where I managed to trick my team into believing I wasn\'t.</p><p dir="ltr">Therein lies Fire Emblem Shadows\' next, and arguably biggest, issue--identifying the Shadow doesn\'t feel like it matters nearly enough. The game goes out of its way to make sure you understand that the vote isn\'t the end all, be all of the match, as you\'ll still go into round two regardless and can win no matter how the votes were cast. It also ensures you can make an educated vote for the traitor, even if you weren\'t paying attention during the battle. The game outright tells you which players were hit by what kind of magic, and thus might not be the Shadow. This can be manipulated, of course, but in most of the matches I played, simply picking the person who wasn\'t harmed by shadow magic turned out to be the traitor.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Intelligent Systems wants to have its cake and eat it too. It wants players to engage with the social-deduction system but seems wary of making it too important. It wants players to pay attention during battle and piece together who the traitor might be, but it also wants to just straight-up tell you the clues in case you weren\'t paying attention and doesn\'t give you time to think about it. It just doesn\'t work, as a social-deduction game or as a strategy title.</p><p dir="ltr">This is all without even mentioning Fire Emblem Shadow\'s free-to-play monetization, where you can spend real money on a premium currency called Gems as well as character-specific medals in order to upgrade your roster. If there is one bright side, Fire Emblem Shadows thankfully doesn\'t have a gacha system like many free-to-play mobile games (including Fire Emblem Heroes) and opts to dole out new characters frequently as you play.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, it\'s monetized in other ways. Despite normally needing both character medals and Crystals, another currency earned through playing that is used to upgrade characters, the game is happy to remind you that you could also just buy Gems to bypass all that and level up immediately. While some upgrade materials and Gems can be earned through gameplay, it quickly becomes apparent that those who put money into the game will have substantially stronger characters--so much so that it feels like it undermines the entire social deduction aspect the game is centered around. Certain characters are also locked to the game\'s premium battle pass, meaning that some potentially powerful or popular characters cost extra (currently, it\'s Lyn from Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade).</p><p dir="ltr">Matchmaking has level brackets that ensure players are at least in the same ballpark level-wise, but the very idea of jumping into a random match where some players may have higher-level characters with vastly improved stats and spells is discouraging. Using a Level 1 character fresh out of the tutorial, I could still be paired up against another player with a Level 4 character. The boosts to HP and attack, as well as access to stronger weapons and improved spells from leveling up, are substantial to the degree that a Level 1 has little to no chance against a Level 4, regardless of if they get an extra life for guessing the Shadow\'s identity or not. Combined with having no real control of your character and barely relevant social-deduction elements, and it feels like there is no room or reason for tactics or subterfuge when the real answer is always brute force. If one can pay to bypass the game\'s core idea and simply beat the opposition to a pulp regardless of whether they win or lose the social-deduction round, what is even the point?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4578408-8393356349-FireE.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578408" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4578408-8393356349-FireE.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578408"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4578408-8393356349-FireE.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4578408-8393356349-FireE.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4578408-8393356349-FireE.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/43/434805/4578408-8393356349-FireE.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a></figure><p dir="ltr">Fire Emblem Shadows is most recognizably Fire Emblem in its roster of characters and presentation. Character designs are full of personality, and it\'s cool to see how those designs morph and change when playing as the Shadow. As you continue to play as a character, you unlock Rapport with them, allowing you to learn more about their backstory. All the while, the game drip-feeds the main story to you through visual-novel-style, voice-acted dialogue scenes, with separate storylines for playing as the Shadow or as a Disciple of the Light. These elements all feel true to the franchise even if its gameplay doesn\'t, but are hardly worth grinding through boring battles when it often feels like you have no real agency over the outcome. It doesn\'t help that much of the story requires repeatedly playing matches as a Disciple of Light, despite it being much more fun to play as a Shadow.</p><p dir="ltr">There is a nugget of a good idea here, and one that is interesting on paper. Unfortunately, Fire Emblem Shadows\' most innovative ideas bump up against its mobile and free-to-play nature, resulting in a game that is both not for Fire Emblem fans and hard to recommend to anyone.</p>',

To EA\'s credit, it\'s a pretty good upgrade, all things considered. This is partly due to how off the mark EA FC 25 was, but also because of a concerted effort to solve some of the series\' longstanding issues by focusing on player feedback. The end result is an interesting attempt to appeal to every type of player. It\'s not wholly successful in this ambition, but EA FC 26 is at least a step in the right direction.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575273-ss_e746dd5cc1e4c2b36bcc66d6b0780a02e7c55cea.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575273" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575273-ss_e746dd5cc1e4c2b36bcc66d6b0780a02e7c55cea.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575273"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4575273-ss_e746dd5cc1e4c2b36bcc66d6b0780a02e7c55cea.1920x1080.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575273-ss_e746dd5cc1e4c2b36bcc66d6b0780a02e7c55cea.1920x1080.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4575273-ss_e746dd5cc1e4c2b36bcc66d6b0780a02e7c55cea.1920x1080.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/43/434805/4575273-ss_e746dd5cc1e4c2b36bcc66d6b0780a02e7c55cea.1920x1080.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a></figure><p dir="ltr">The headlining change is a shift to two distinct playstyles. The series has always felt somewhat different when played online compared to offline, but the feeling is now much more pronounced and extends beyond the foibles of online netcode. Competitive and Authentic gameplay presets make a marked difference in how the match engine handles. You can choose between either one when playing offline, but online modes, such as Ultimate Team, are locked into the Competitive playstyle (even when playing Squad Battles against the CPU).</p><p dir="ltr">The Competitive preset is all about player skill. The pace of the game is rapid, with passes ping-ponging between players\' feet, and the spotlight is on dribbling, skill moves, and consistently high-scoring matches. Despite this proclivity for attacking football, defending has also been improved. Successful tackles actually regain possession, rather than knocking the ball right back to the attacking player\'s feet, so a lot of the frustration from previous entries has been exorcised.</p><p dir="ltr">That\'s not to say you won\'t feel outmatched, though. The midfield in online games is practically nonexistent when defending. There\'s so much space, passes are so fast, and it feels so responsive that it only takes a couple of passes to reach the edge of the opposition\'s box. This, then, is where the vast majority of tackling occurs. I\'ve tried preventing this by playing two defensive midfielders and setting instructions for them to stay back, but it makes no difference; players off the ball are too static. With so much of the game spent near the boxes, it only takes one missed tackle or a burst of speed for the attacking team to go clean through on goal. As a result, games are typically high scoring, with scorelines like 5-4, 6-2, and 8-7 being the norm.</p><p dir="ltr">Goalkeepers are marginally better--less likely to parry the ball back into dangerous areas--but keeping a clean sheet (or limiting your opponent to fewer than two goals) is still a miracle. There\'s a significant element of skill involved in defending, mainly because you can\'t just rely on the AI to do it for you, but the odds are still heavily stacked against you. If there were more of a midfield battle, tackling wouldn\'t be as risky, and this would lead to fewer chances for each team overall. In its current state, Competitive matches are enjoyable when you have the ball, but mostly overwhelming when you don\'t. It\'s still an improvement on last year\'s game, where frustration was the prevailing feeling when playing online, but it\'s not without issues.</p><p dir="ltr">The Authentic preset, on the other hand, can be enabled when playing offline, altering the gameplay to provide a closer approximation of real football. The pace is significantly slower, placing a greater emphasis on each individual phase of play, with tactical midfield battles, physical defending, and methodical build-up play. Other variables can also affect matches, such as wind altering the trajectory of crosses and a wet pitch causing the ball to either skid across the surface or slow down. Authentic offers a more considered way of playing, although, like previous games in the series, the CPU isn\'t the most appealing opponent. It\'s either too easy to play against or slightly overpowered and able to keep possession of the ball for long stretches of time, so you\'ll likely need to tinker with the sliders to find a suitable balance.</p><p dir="ltr">It\'s a shame there\'s no way to use the Authentic preset online, but the single-player Manager Career is at least more interesting this time around. A new Manager Live feature lets you play out different scenarios and challenge yourself beyond the norm. There\'s one that tasks you with avoiding relegation after beginning the season with a 20-point deduction, and another that asks you to lead Real Madrid to a domestic double while starting Jude Bellingham in at least 25 matches. Others are centered on being top of the table at Christmas or earning a certain amount of money in transfer fees. It\'s a different way to play that freshens up the experience for those who enjoy playing through multiple careers, especially if you fancy an extra challenge.</p><p dir="ltr">Unexpected Events is another new feature that throws a few curveballs at you throughout a season. These random scenarios inject some personality into the off-field aspect of Manager Career, breaking up the drudgery of simulating from one match to the next. This can result in your plans being disrupted by losing two players for the next game because they clashed in training and injured one another, or ate some dodgy food the night before. Another player might come to you feeling homesick, forcing you to make a decision, or the club might get taken over by new owners, altering your expectations and increasing the transfer budget. Football Manager players are no strangers to events like this, but they bring some of the unpredictability of real-world football to EA FC\'s career mode, forcing you to adapt to an ever-changing landscape.</p><p dir="ltr">Ultimate Team has also undergone some adjustments, introducing new features while course-correcting with others. In the latter\'s case, I\'m referring to Rivals and the reintroduction of relegation, which banishes the days of being stuck in a division you\'re clearly not good enough for. Progression in Rivals has also been improved by adding bonus objectives that can net you in-game coins and extra points for the weekly rewards. In one game, I earned 2,000 coins by starting a Team of the Week player in my team, then added more points by scoring two consecutive goals, fulfilling two of the objectives.</p><p dir="ltr">Doing this feels crucial because there are fewer rewards in general, and most of those you do receive are untradeable. This is part of EA\'s attempt to slow the game\'s power curve, which even replaces Ultimate Team\'s previous season pass with a game-wide pass, allowing you to earn XP in career mode, Ultimate Team, and Clubs for rewards in all three modes. I\'m not a fan. If I\'m playing Ultimate Team, I don\'t particularly care about unlocking FIFA 15 legend Seydou Doumbia as a manager in career mode; I\'d rather have more packs and players to upgrade my team.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575274-ss_b2bcda2e36966161937db451509f9922901b6145.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575274" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575274-ss_b2bcda2e36966161937db451509f9922901b6145.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575274"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4575274-ss_b2bcda2e36966161937db451509f9922901b6145.1920x1080.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575274-ss_b2bcda2e36966161937db451509f9922901b6145.1920x1080.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4575274-ss_b2bcda2e36966161937db451509f9922901b6145.1920x1080.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/43/434805/4575274-ss_b2bcda2e36966161937db451509f9922901b6145.1920x1080.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a></figure><p dir="ltr">To compound the issue, the season pass has also been gutted to make room for a premium version that requires real money to purchase. This always feels like an egregious practice outside of free-to-play games, but especially when the series has featured a free season pass for the previous few years. It\'s commendable that EA wants to slow down the power curve, but it remains to be seen how effective this will be, given that people willing to spend real money can earn more rewards from the season pass and purchase numerous packs in the in-game store.</p><p dir="ltr">This is one of the legacy issues that will, unfortunately, never go away, simply because it makes money. Others, such as inconsistent tackling, inaccurate passing, and a stale career mode, have thankfully been addressed in positive ways. The Competitive preset still favors the attacking team a little too much, and in an attempt to appease every type of football fan, EA Sports FC 26 misses the target. It\'s close, though. There are flaws on and off the pitch, yet this is the best the series has been for a short while. It might not walk away with a trophy this year, but it\'s getting closer to glory.</p><p> </p>',

      body: '<p dir="ltr">In 2020\'s Ghost of Tsushima, protagonist Jin Sakai is a samurai, part of Japan\'s ruling class during the Kamakura period in which the game is set. When Khotun Khan and his Mongolian army attack Jin\'s home island of Tsushima, the samurai is unable to repel the invading force as the noble warrior he was forged to be, and must instead sever his honor by becoming the fearsome "Ghost." Yet adopting underhanded tactics to gain the edge comes at a cost, as Jin is forced to grapple with sacrificing his relationships, his moral code, and everything he once stood for in an effort to defeat an unconventional foe.</p><p dir="ltr">In Ghost of Yotei, protagonist Atsu doesn\'t have to make such choices. She\'s not a samurai, but a wandering mercenary from an ignoble family--a family that was slaughtered at the hands of a gang of violent outlaws known as the Yotei Six. With everything taken from her, Atsu\'s gender and lowly status mean she has no fixed standing in Japanese society during the early 1600s.</p><p dir="ltr">Alone and consumed by revenge, she carves her own path forward, adopting the mantle of the onryo, a vengeful spirit from Japanese folklore that\'s able to inflict harm in the world of the living. Like Jin, Atsu becomes a symbol--one that strikes fear into the hearts of her enemies as her legend grows. But while this parallel is notable, it\'s the differences between Jin and Atsu that stand out the most.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the game\'s foundation remains largely unchanged from its predecessor, the shift from samurai to roaming sellsword introduces a number of interesting changes and fresh ideas in what is a marked improvement on Ghost of Tsushima. Exploring the natural beauty of Sucker Punch\'s romanticized depiction of Feudal Japan is enjoyable in and of itself, but the activities you\'ll discover are also much more meaningful than before--tying together Atsu, her home, and her family--while the precise brutality of its highly stylized combat has been expanded upon with a diverse arsenal of tools and melee weapons, resulting in tense and thrilling battles ingrained with cinematic flair.</p><p dir="ltr">Like its predecessor, Ghost of Yotei is a classic tale of revenge, inspired by samurai cinema. You can see the influence of legendary filmmakers like Akira Kurosawa, Masaki Kobayashi, and Kenji Misumi in facets of its cinematography, melee combat, and storytelling, but it\'s Toshiya Fujita\'s Lady Snowblood that comes to mind as the most thematically similar. After Atsu\'s family is massacred and she\'s left for dead, the young orphan spends the next 16 years away from home, honing her skills on the Japanese mainland by fighting in peasant armies as the country raged war with itself. After the famous Battle of Sekigahara, Atsu returns home to the northern island of Ezo (modern-day Hokkaido), prepared to enact her revenge on the Yotei Six by any means necessary.</p><p dir="ltr">At the beginning of the game, Atsu doesn\'t care whether she lives or dies, so long as the Yotei Six meet their end. But while she spent the past 16 years transforming into a fearsome warrior, the targets of her ire grew stronger too. Now, the Yotei Six have legions of soldiers to call on, with the group\'s leader--the antagonistic Saito--proclaiming himself the Shogun of the north.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Atsu is comfortable being alone and knows how to fend for herself, it becomes clear that she\'s an underdog and must learn to rely on others if she hopes to defeat the Yotei Six. While the world at large might perceive her as a terrifying ghost, she\'s also someone who\'s gradually shaped by the brutal cost of revenge and the influence of the people she meets. Atsu\'s character arc is compelling and offers an interesting juxtaposition to Ghost of Tsushima\'s story. It\'s still a fairly conventional revenge tale, but one that\'s well told, with memorable characters, excellent performances from its optional Japanese voice cast (at least to my non-speaker ears), and a plethora of stunning moments and unexpected twists.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the more effective aspects of the narrative is Atsu\'s relationship with her family. Almost everything she does is influenced by them in some way. By visiting her home and specific locations around Ezo, you can step into the past and revisit fond memories from her childhood, such as practicing sword fighting with her brother and working with her weaponsmith father in the family\'s forge. These windows into the past create further empathy for a character who eventually goes on to inflict brutal violence. You can feel the weight of her loss in each moment, and this persists throughout the game as you explore more and more of Ezo.</p><p dir="ltr">Bamboo strikes, fox dens, hot springs, and Shinto shrines return, though they\'re fewer in number than before. Crucially, there are also new activities that further Atsu\'s characterization and relationship with her family. It\'s easy to note the differences with Jin here once again. While he was a scholarly samurai--taking contemplative moments to express himself through haikus--Atsu\'s interests are shaped by her upbringing. Her father taught her the art of Sumi-e, which literally translates to "black ink painting," and her love of the craft is reflected in moments when you are asked to use the DualSense\'s touchpad to paint the various animals and landscapes you encounter throughout your journey.</p><p dir="ltr">Atsu also travels with a shamisen--a three-stringed instrument played with a large plectrum called a bachi--which was passed down from her grandmother to her mother, then from her mother to her, along with the wisdom that music can still reach those who have passed. Yet playing and learning new songs on the shamisen doesn\'t merely serve as a way to connect Atsu with her mother and lineage--it connects her to her homeland and its people, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghost of Yotei is set over 300 years after the events of Ghost of Tsushima, right at the beginning of Japan\'s Edo period. After winning the aforementioned Battle of Sekigahara, the renowned warrior Tokugawa Ieyasu hunted down and executed anyone who opposed him, folding those who accepted into his shogunate. With so many daimyo losing their domains, around 150,000 samurai became ronin around this time, with many of those fleeing to Ezo as a place to live free from the oppressive rule of the Tokugawa shogunate. With the Yotei Six already causing disruption, Ezo feels a lot like the Wild West. As Atsu\'s fame grows, so does the number of ronin hoping to cash in her bounty. But as a sellsword, Atsu can also take on a variety of bounty contracts herself, hunting down the island\'s most fearsome warriors.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of these targets are distinct; there\'s one involving a murderous musician that\'s actually quite touching, and another about a killer who drowns his victims, akin to a kappa. Sometimes you need to use clues to figure out where they\'re hiding; other times they\'ll come to you, like a particular serial killer who preys on weary travellers making camp for the night. Most of these encounters conclude with an exciting one-on-one duel, but there are some unexpected outcomes, too. Like much of Ghost of Yotei\'s side content, these bounty missions are relatively brief but engaging. It\'s just a shame that a few of them are rather generic, asking you to defeat a regular enemy within an occupied camp, for instance. For a game that often avoids this pitfall, these missteps are more obvious.</p><p dir="ltr">However, picking up bounties is just one of the ways you\'ll interact with Ghost of Yotei\'s world. The Guiding Wind mechanic returns from the first game, directing you to your chosen objective with gusts of wind, flying leaves, and bending grass. Five years on, it\'s still the best way to navigate an open world, ensuring that you\'re fully absorbed in the space you\'re inhabiting rather than constantly staring at a mini-map or objective marker. You\'re also more likely to spot points of interest this way, such as smoke from a campfire or an alluring building on the horizon. Atsu even has a Breath of the Wild-style spyglass, which automatically adds locations to the in-game map once you\'ve spotted them through the telescopic lens. It\'s a great way to make you pay attention to your surroundings and internalize key landmarks.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr">Like Jin, Atsu becomes a symbol--one that strikes fear into the hearts of her enemies as her legend grows. But while this parallel is notable, it\'s the differences between Jin and Atsu that stand out the most</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">The people of Ezo are eager to share information, too. Upon arriving in a new village, a merchant might tell you about an onsen that\'s not too far away. You can set up camp to eat food and craft ammo, and a passerby may join you and mention a fox den, while interrogating an enemy could reveal a nearby camp. Your exploration is gently guided, but it feels very natural. Instead of looking at a map filled with markers, you\'re left to discover things on your own, even if you\'re sometimes nudged in the right direction. You\'re peering into the world rather than staring at a UI, so there\'s an inherent sense of discovery that persists throughout the game and is very rewarding.</p><p dir="ltr">It\'s incredibly easy to get sidetracked, even when you have a specific objective in mind. Exploring and engaging with whatever you find is just as fulfilling as playing through the main story, mainly because Ezo feels so alive and lived-in--from a village where people are fishing, conversing around a campfire, and playing music, to the diverse natural landscapes and wildlife of Japan\'s northernmost island. Hokkaido is renowned for its natural beauty, and Sucker Punch has certainly captured that with Ghost of Yotei\'s open world, further enhancing the distinct visual identity introduced in Ghost of Tsushima. It\'s grandiose and almost fantastical at times, but it\'s a constant treat for the eyes, full of bold, saturated colors and an abundance of flying particles that make each and every frame feel full of life.</p><p dir="ltr">Great plains stretch as far as the eye can see, lakes and streams in the wetlands reflect the glistening moon, and the sea violently clashes against the jagged cliffs on the coast. Vibrant red and auburn trees sit atop rolling green hills, cherry blossom trees paint the south of the island pink, while the north is blanketed in freezing ice and snow. Duels are frequently framed against a backdrop of picturesque mountains, turgid waterfalls, and centuries-old trees--their branches twisting outward like undulating rivers. Colorful butterflies, dragonflies, and flower petals swirl as steel clashes, caught in the howling wind, and each purposeful step forward kicks up fallen leaves and splashes of water. As blood hits the pristine snow, Lady Snowblood springs to mind once again. If nothing else, Ezo is a land of striking contrasts.</p><p dir="ltr">Technically, it\'s as impressive as Sony\'s first-party titles often are. Ezo\'s map is divided into sections, with new locations splintering off from a large starting area. When you climb aboard your horse\'s saddle, black bars appear at the top and bottom of the screen, reducing the picture size but framing the environment to really show off the superb art direction. There aren\'t any noticeable frame drops using the game\'s performance mode on a base PS5. Outside of cutscenes, which are locked at 30fps, it runs at a stable 60fps throughout.</p><p dir="ltr">It\'s the hunt for the Yotei Six that brings you to almost every corner of the island, where you\'ll also discover more about each member of the gang as you plot out their demise. The Oni, for instance, resides in a hilltop castle overlooking the entire Ishhikari Plain. He\'s a mountain of a man with an army behind him, so the burned villages and widows left in their wake reveal his abject cruelty. The Kitsune, on the other hand, works in the shadows. As the head of a clan of shinobi, their methods are more clandestine, forcing you to solve puzzles to uncover secret hideouts. Their foot soldiers emerge from beneath the snow, and the terror they inflict on the people of Teshio Ridge isn\'t as obvious as the Oni\'s fire and brimstone approach, with millers and blacksmiths simply disappearing in the night.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghost of Yotei\'s mission design is similarly varied, whether you\'re posing as an anonymous bounty hunter to infiltrate a fortress or pursuing a target through a mountain range as they pepper you with gunfire--and that\'s just the main story missions. Side quests take you on a few unexpected adventures involving rumors of terrifying yokai, a brush with a near-indestructible bear, and some enlightening platforming with Ezo\'s indigenous Ainu people. The end result is often the same: You\'ll typically utilize stealth or combat to solve most problems. But there\'s much more flavor than before, making for a more interesting game from one moment to the next, as it ditches the rigidity that frequently plagued Ghost of Tsushima\'s mission design.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat is also improved, and molded, once again, by Atsu\'s singular nature. She fights to win by any means necessary, even if that means picking up a fallen enemy\'s weapon and throwing it through another\'s chest, chucking dirt into her opponent\'s eyes, or lighting her weapon on fire to break through a staunch defense. She\'s also not averse to using a variety of different melee weapons, trading Jin\'s four katana stances for five distinct armaments. You begin with a katana, and then, by visiting various teachers, gradually unlock an odachi, a kusarigama, dual katanas, and a yari spear.</p><p dir="ltr">There\'s a rock, paper, scissors dynamic in play where certain weapons are better suited against particular enemies and their chosen equipment. The kusarigama, for instance, can destroy shields with consecutive blows from its heavy attack, while the relentless speed of the dual katanas is ideal for dealing with opponents wielding yari. As one of your teachers puts it, every weapon can kill but won\'t necessarily always shine. A single katana can still best a yari user, but you won\'t deal as much damage, and breaking through their guard is much tougher. Using the wrong weapon feels inefficient, so you\'ll want to frequently cycle through your arsenal depending on who you\'re facing to cleave through enemies with style and precision. Throw in new ranged weapons like the slow-loading Tanegashima rifle and a flintlock pistol that\'s useful for interrupting enemy attacks, and there are quite a few considerations to make when engaged in combat.</p><p dir="ltr">Whichever weapon you\'re wielding can fell opponents in a few quick slices, but the same is also true of Atsu. Whether you\'re dueling a single opponent or dealing with a one-versus-many situation, you\'ll want to master blocking, parrying, and dodging to survive and create openings for your own deadly offense. This manifests in a terrific ebb and flow as you alternate between being active and reactive. Atsu\'s fragility creates tension, but she also feels decidedly deadly. It\'s a satisfying combination, especially when you factor in a suite of fluid animations and the terrific sound design that accompanies the clashing of weapons and splitting of flesh.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat isn\'t without its flaws, however. Like the first game, Ghost of Yotei there are a few instances where enemies will slip out of view, forcing you to awkwardly pull your fingers away from the face buttons to manually adjust the camera with the right stick. This isn\'t ideal when you need to react quickly to unblockable attacks and incoming projectiles, but it\'s rare enough that it isn\'t a significant problem.</p><figure data-align="center"

some situations. Ghost of Yotei\'s stealth is played fast and loose; it\'s more about taking out everybody as quickly and violently as possible rather than slipping by unnoticed. Chaining together assassinations never tires, and using the kusarigama to yank enemies out of sight is particularly gratifying. The stealthy route might be relatively uncomplicated for the most part, but that doesn\'t prevent how enjoyable it is to sweep through an enemy camp as a silent assassin.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghost of Yotei builds and improves upon its predecessor with a gripping story, rewarding exploration, and fantastic combat, with each aspect emphasizing the characteristics of a new protagonist. As a sequel, familiarity is baked in, but every alteration is in service of Atsu and her profound differences, making for a game that manages to feel distinct even when what you\'re doing is so recognizable. The Ghost is just a mask; what matters is who\'s behind it.</p>',

      body: '<p dir="ltr">Just like the first game, Hades 2 launched first in early access, allowing developer Supergiant Games to delicately tweak and balance gameplay, as well as add new content before its full launch. And, like the first game, that time was not wasted.</p><p dir="ltr">Hades 2 exits early access as a finely-honed and deeply engaging roguelite that builds upon the strong foundations established by the first game. It\'s larger in every way, with more characters and conversations to enjoy, an entirely new roster of weapons to learn, and deeper customization options to its expanded combat system, yet none of these upgrades compromise Hades\' legacy. Rather, Hades 2 improves upon its predecessor in every way, making it a masterfully crafted sequel that is essential to play.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead of playing as Zagreus again, you play as his sister, Melinoe, who was born after the events of the first game. Your journey with the witchling begins shortly after the titan Chronos usurps the throne and takes over Hades\'s domain, banishing Hades, Persephone, Zagreus, and the other Chthonic gods as he does so. Melinoe, saved from the unknown fate of her family, has been raised to realize one simple goal: Death to Chronos. That goal is realized over many, many treks through Hades and beyond, with each run featuring randomized elements, including the enemies you\'ll face and the upgrades you\'ll earn along the way. With the help of her mentor, fellow titan Hecate, and a cast of new and returning gods, shades, and all those in between, Hades 2 sets out strongly from the get-go with a story that is gripping to watch unfold between runs.</p><p dir="ltr">For all of its improvements, Hades 2 doesn\'t initially look or feel that different from the original. Both games operate with the same isometric viewpoint, and Melinoe moves with the same speed and grace as her brother, albeit with some slight changes. Unlike Zagreus, Melinoe is far less dash-happy, with a longer cooldown between each of her evasive bursts of speed that\'s initially awkward to get used to. This is offset by a greater emphasis on maintaining speed through sprinting, which you engage by holding down the dash button right after executing it.</p><p dir="ltr">This sprint provides the same degree of damage-avoidance Zagreus enjoys but feeds into additional offensive options. And some enemies are designed specifically to punish a reliance on just dashing to encourage a shift in mindset. The sprint can also be upgraded with boons, the random upgrades you receive at various points during a run, in a similar fashion to your standard attacks, letting your sprint shock foes with Zeus\' lighting, or knock back entire groups of them with the powerful waves of Poseidon. This tangible change is a taste of how Hades 2 approaches evolving a strong, established formula by making small, sometimes experimental, changes that have a profound effect on the way you approach gameplay.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4573961-hades2_apr24_04large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4573961"

Melinoe\'s offensive repertoire. She maintains the trio of options that her brother had with standard, special, and cast attacks; both the standard and special attacks are determined by your selection of a weapon when you begin a run. This is already delightfully varied, with the starting Witch Staff offering a nice balance between safe ranged melee strikes, while others, such as the Sister Blades, demand a bolder approach, since their limited range forces you to really get in the face of enemies.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Melinoe\'s cast ability is also far more useful without boons than Zagreus\'s awkward red diamond projectile ever was. In keeping with her witch abilities, Melinoe can throw down a circular ring that confines enemies inside it for a brief period of time, making it an effective crowd-controlling option at its default tier. Boons from the gods can radically evolve it, though, turning the defensive snare into a more offensive area-of-effect spell that decimates large groups of foes or inflicts harmful curses on them. These can also be combined with other boons that augment your standard weapons to create a deadly mixture of skills.</p><p dir="ltr">Melinoe\'s cast ability is just one of the biggest changes Hades 2 introduces for its refined approach to combat. Each of your three attacks can also be channeled into new Omega attacks, which you can think of as alternative fire modes for each. The standard attack of the slow and cumbersome Moonstone Axe can be channeled into a fast and devastating spinning attack, for example, while the single shots of the Black Coat\'s special attack can transform into a lock-on missile barrage that quickly melts away lonesome enemies. These are powered by magic, which is a new resource you need to manage between each skirmish. It refills automatically as you enter a new room, encouraging you to maximize its usage during each battle while also making you think about ways to keep it topped up while you\'re in the thick of things.</p><p dir="ltr">All of these combat abilities are empowered by gifts Melinoe receives from the various characters you\'ll run into during each run. There are familiar faces, such as Aphrodite and Hermes, as well as entirely new ones. Hestia, for example, offers her flame damage-dealing boons as a way to introduce damage-over-time strategies to Melinoe’s repertoire, while Hera\'s new Hitch curse lets you mark several enemies and then deal damage to all of them simultaneously. Each boon gives you specific elemental abilities to play around with, letting you cobble together a combination that plays off each one\'s strengths to make the most of a run.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">... big, bold swings have established Hades 2 as one of the best roguelites you\'re likely ever going to play</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">With six distinct weapons to use, more boons to imbue them with, a variety of keepsakes from friends and foes that influence runs, and a handful of animal familiars to choose from, Hades 2 provides so many levers to pull and knobs to turn that it\'s unlikely you\'ll ever feel like you\'re doomed to an inconsequential run. Yes, you\'ll still have ones that go a lot better (or worse) than others, but there wasn\'t one I played that didn\'t feel instructive or enlightening in some way.</p><p dir="ltr">All of these options are also introduced at a steady but measured pace, never overwhelming you with new mechanics before you\'ve got a grasp of those you have access to. Each new wrinkle is another piece in a larger puzzle that eventually lets you have more consistently successful runs, rewarding the thought you\'ve put into both the preparation before them and the execution of a build during each one. It\'s an engrossing formula that makes the much-lauded original seem like a nascent idea by comparison, and exemplifies the ambition shown by Supergiant Games with its sequel. It would\'ve been easier to make smaller, iterative changes to a highly-regarded combat loop, but big, bold swings have established Hades 2 as one of the best roguelites you\'re likely ever going to play.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4573962-hades2_apr24_08large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4573962" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4573962-hades2_apr24_08large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4573962"><img alt="Hades 2" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4573962-hades2_apr24_08large.jpeg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4573962-hades2_apr24_08large.jpeg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/123/1239113/4573962-hades2_apr24_08large.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a><figcaption>Hades 2</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>This additional depth to combat is kept entertaining thanks to an entirely new roster of enemies to contend with, many of which demand a quick understanding of the new combat avenues available to you and how best to take advantage of them. Simple, slow-swinging brutes might be commonplace in the first few encounters of a run, but they\'re quickly supplanted by seemingly neverending waves of small but deadly floating fish in later ones, or heavily armored soldiers that require quick reflexes to keep out of their wide-reaching melee strikes. Boss encounters are the true standouts though, ranging from an interesting roster of mid-bosses that you\'ll encounter quite frequently, to the show-stopping skirmishes that await you at the end of each biome.</span></p><p dir="ltr">These are massive climactic battles against Hades 2\'s most-challenging foes, each with their own fascinating theme around them. A standout is Scylla and the Sirens, which pits you against three foes with distinct abilities in a musically charged battle that borders on overwhelming the first few times you undertake it. It\'s a layered battle that challenges you to cleverly balance which of the three you\'re going to focus on at a given time in order to remove their respective attack from the equation. This is just one of many that are both audio and visual treats, crammed with eye-catching effects and accentuated by Hades 2\'s exceptional soundtrack, composed again by Darren Korb. The music melds a thumping double-bass and roaring electric guitar with the smooth vocals of Ashley Barrett, who continues to outdo themself with each new game they feature in. It\'s tough to pick a favorite among the pairs work across Supergiant\'s suite of games, but there hasn\'t been one this varied and full-bodied as this.</p><p dir="ltr">Each of Hades 2\'s biomes also marks a departure from the environments from the first game, which might be a relief to hear given you\'ll be mostly traversing the depths of Hades again. Alternative paths lead you to new areas that are bursting with color and character, with Supergiant\'s distinctive art style shown in its best light here. Hades 2 features an outstanding reimagining of the depths of Hell, which is accentuated by the nostalgic return of familiar spaces in the game\'s later, and more climatic, sections.</p><p dir="ltr">It\'s surprising, too, that traveling down the levels of Hades is not the only path you can take, with an entirely different route to take during a run opened a few hours into your playthrough. This expands Hades 2\'s content well beyond what was offered in the original game, with the original four biomes supplanted by more than twice that. This expansion doesn\'t come at the expense of quality either, with each biome rendered in Supergiant\'s immediately recognizable art style. Hades 2 is the best looking game the studio has delivered yet, and the richest it\'s ever crafted, with an immense amount of detail poured into each space that gives them presence within the wider mythos of Hades\' world. The scorched streets of a city ravaged by war stand in contrast to the clinically clean halls of the usurped underworld, the underwater boiling rooms of the siren\'s forgotten nightclub opening out to wide open fields littered with lost souls. Hades 2\'s world is diverse and memorable, and not just because you\'ll be traveling though it time and time again.</p><p dir="ltr">The areas are also more mechanically varied, with a few offering larger spaces that you can explore while giving you the chance to choose which routes to take and when. It serves to break up the monotony of moving strictly from one room to the next linearly, but the sheer variety on offer makes it difficult for that to ever feel like a problem that needs solving in the first place. The choices of which narrative threads to follow, along with the quantity of content added to the overall package, just further show how much more ambitious Supergiant is with its first-ever sequel.</p><p dir="ltr">While you\'ll spend the majority of your time dungeon-crawling your way to success, Hades 2 puts a bigger emphasis on what you do in between runs, too. The Crossroads, a refuge that sits between the base of Mount Olympus and the depth of Hades, acts as the sequel\'s analog to the first game\'s House of Hades post-run hangout spot, offering up a multitude of base-building options that all have tangible impacts on your effectiveness during runs. A large, bubbling cauldron in the center lets you combine resources to unlock new parts of the Crossroads, as well as helpful shops and newer resource types to collect when you venture back out. A small garden lets you plant specific seeds that sprout while you\'re out, folding back into the requirements for more expansion via the aforementioned cauldron.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4573963-hades2_apr24_07large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4573963" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4573963-hades2_apr24_07large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4573963"><img alt="The Crossroads in Hades 2" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4573963-hades2_apr24_07large.jpeg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4573963-hades2_apr24_07large.jpeg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/123/1239113/4573963-hades2_apr24_07large.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a><figcaption>The Crossroads in Hades 2</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>The Crossroads also includes specific activity spaces that let you take characters out on small dates, both friendly and a little more intimate, which provide more environments for more narrative progression to take place in. Customization options are also more expansive than in Hades, letting you decorate and personalize the space to make it feel more homey between each run. While Hades 2 makes it easy to bounce from one run to the next, having a little more to do between them is a welcome addition.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Paramount to permanent character progression is a new arcana card system that replaces Zagreus\'s one-dimensional upgrade mirror from the first game. Each card gives you an advantage of some sort during your run. This can be as simple as rewarding you with a Death Defiance, which keeps you alive after an otherwise fatal blow, or buffing your total magic and health even before a run starts. Others, like the ability to deal additional damage to foes with two curses, or buffing damage while your magic isn\'t fully replenished, define a tone and strategy to your run before starting, helping you craft your play style accordingly as you go.</p><p dir="ltr">The number of arcana cards you can equip is determined by your Grasp, a numerical total that you can expand with a different resource as you chip away at runs. Each card has an associated cost depending on its overall effect, so you\'re challenged to balance which ones to equip based on your capabilities at a given time. The more cards you unlock, and the more Grasp you obtain, the bigger advantage you take into a run, and thus the greater chance you have of completion. It\'s a far more dynamic system than the on-off switches in the previous game, tying in nicely to the already deeper choices you have available in combat.</p><p dir="ltr">The Crossroads is also integral to the way Hades 2 tells its tale. The stakes of the story are more profound here, trading Zagreus\'s petulant plight to escape his home with a wide-reaching conflict that threatens not only Melinoe and her family, but every corner of the underworld, the surface above, and the gods looking down from the mountaintop. Chronos is a suitably harrowing villain who consistently pops up to threaten you as you\'re nearing him, while also reveling in all your defeats, making the many times you\'ll best him satisfying victories.</p><blockquote data-size="small" data-align="right"><p dir="ltr">Hades 2 is a game that is essential to experience</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">But Chronos is just one of many fantastic foils along the way, with Hades 2 giving time for each main antagonist to shine in their own way. They, along with your allies at The Crossroads, all react believably to each of your actions, remarking on your weapon choices, the boons you\'ve picked up along the way, the manners in which you were defeated, and more. Just like in the first game, this is where Hades 2 really distinguishes itself from its peers in the genre, with the unbelievable way in which its script incorporates each of your actions fluidly into its core narrative to make it feel like the story is being written as you play. It\'s the strongest hook that the original game possessed, one that no peer has matched since, and one that Hades 2 surpasses so effortlessly.</p><p dir="ltr">The roster of characters you\'ll interact with is also much larger than in Hades. The Crossroads is home to a variety of different personalities, such as the sassy but insecure shade, Dora; the masterful tactician Odysseus; and another of Nyx\'s many offspring, Nemesis. The gods that you\'ll meet along your path also lean more into their recognizable archetypes, with newer additions to the cast such as Narcissus, Prometheus, and Icarus standing out the most.</p><p dir="ltr">Voice acting is exceptional throughout, a feat made even more impressive only once you\'ve experienced what seems like an endless stream of captivating dialogue that empowers the hundreds of permutations you can come across each run. Melinoe is often witness to the incessant bickering between the pantheon of gods, titans, and those caught in between, and sometimes the cruelty they let spill out into the world, but Hades 2 deftly interweaves brevity and witty writing that keeps the tale endearing. It\'s captivating to watch Melinoe\'s relationships with each of these characters evolve with each passing night, making you crave each new interaction and giving the story more depth than the revenge plot at its core.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether you were witness to all the work done on Hades 2 during early access or not, there\'s no denying how much effort developer Supergiant Games has put into this masterful sequel. Hades 2 is one of the best roguelite experiences ever, with clever improvements to its established formula that accentuate its strongest attributes. More importantly, it achieves this without requiring you to be the most well-versed player on what came before, but not at the expense of offering a new challenge to those that have spent hours digging away at the first game\'s most brutal endeavors. It\'s deeper and more complex than the original in every way, from its greatly expanded combat system to its larger, more complex web of character interactions that powers its more ambitious narrative.</p><p dir="ltr">Hades 2 is a game that is essential to experience, with all of its parts coalescing into a memorable adventure that you will likely lose dozens of hours to without regret.</p>',

      score: "9.0",
      deck: "The Ivalice Chronicles provides the best way to play an all-time classic, even if it lacks some of the archival glow-up it deserves.",
      good: "A touched-up script and excellent voice acting help the story shine|Subtle but well-done modernizations like difficulty levels and new story chronicle tools|Graphical overhaul looks great and honors the original look|Including a (mostly) faithful original version is a nice archival touch",
      bad: "Character portraits look rough in places|No original translation or War of the Lions classes keeps it from feeling truly definitive",
      body: '<p dir="ltr">I\'m old enough to remember how it felt to first play Final Fantasy Tactics in 1997--to remember its stirring score, deep tactical combat, and most of all, the complex story of broken relationships and valor set against a bitter, conspiracy-laden battle for royal succession. It all came together to create an unforgettable experience. More than nearly any game of its time, I was so rapt in it that I would find my mind frequently wandering back to it, planning new strategies, wondering what would happen next.</p><p dir="ltr">Tactics is a game that has lived on as a cult classic with sporadic attempts at giving it its due, as with 2007\'s War of the Lions. The Ivalice Chronicles is the latest and best version so far, modernizing just enough to keep its spirit intact and enhance its memorable story without sacrificing its classic charms.</p><p dir="ltr">The story primarily follows the life of Ramza Beoulve, the youngest and most obscure member of a storied house of nobles, and his fractious friendship with Delita Heiral, a commoner who was treated like family by the Beoulve clan. As narration informs us before the game begins, history remembers Delita as the conquering hero of the War of the Lions--but it was the relatively unknown Ramza who should actually be celebrated.</p><p dir="ltr">That framing device, of a scholar uncovering history\'s hidden secrets and revealing lost truths, immediately sets our expectations and raises intriguing questions. How did Delita rise to become a celebrated historical figure? And why was Ramza overlooked? It\'s a small, brilliant way to shade everything we see unfolding afterward.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6466376" data-src="/videos/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review/2300-6466376/" data-width="854" data-height="480" data-video-start="0">          <iframe height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen id="-embed-462750585" class="optanon-category-C0004" data-src="/videos/embed/6466376/"></iframe></div><p dir="ltr">When we join the characters in their own time, it\'s shortly after the resolution of another period of bloodshed, the 50 Years War. The conflict was grueling and strained relations to a breaking point between nobles and commoners. Against this backdrop, the death of a regent leads to a bitter battle over succession, ultimately igniting all-out hostilities known as the War of the Lions. Again, Final Fantasy Tactics establishing a historical record first gives us grounding for interpreting the events.</p><p dir="ltr">The tale of palace intrigue, betrayal, and conspiracy was always one of Final Fantasy Tactics\' best features, but its original translation was hit-or-miss, with some sloppy and even confusing moments. The 2007 PlayStation Portable game Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions retranslated the game and in the process made the translation much more Victorian English, with Shakespearean flourishes. The Ivalice Chronicles uses the War of the Lions translation as a base, but reworks it to accommodate its full voice acting. I don\'t have the War of the Lions translation memorized, so I can\'t attest to the exact differences, but from the standpoint of a fan, it at least seems to be very similar in style and tone.</p><p dir="ltr">The major difference, though, is the voice acting itself. In the same way that your high school English teacher may have told you that Shakespeare is meant to be heard, not read, this translation just feels noticeably more alive than the PSP game\'s when you can hear the characters lending their voices to the lines. The performances add texture and emotions to the text, and the actors were clearly given room to make each role their own by adding groans and affectations.</p><p dir="ltr">Judging by the performances, the actors even seem to have been familiar enough with the full story arc that they were given space to imbue lines with suspicion or foreshadowing that isn\'t necessarily present in the text itself. In a story full of twists and turns that centers highly on betrayal and conspiracy, the performances add intrigue and suspense, as you wonder how much meaning you should read into a character\'s tone.</p><p dir="ltr">But that also means that The Ivalice Chronicles can be extremely talky. While the in-game cutscenes themselves are full of stage direction, with characters moving about the space and impressive sprite work illustrating their gestures, most of the story battles have at least a few interstitial dialogue moments. The flowery language used for the script means these can last a while, so sometimes you\'ll be thinking of your next tactical move and then have your train of thought interrupted by a surprisingly long conversation. The voice acting was so great that I didn\'t want to skip it, but at the same time, sometimes I really just wanted to get on with the battle.</p><p dir="ltr">When I played the original Final Fantasy Tactics as a teenager, it was my first real experience with this style of Elizabethan tragedy, at least outside of an English literature classroom. FFT carries all the same hallmarks in a fantasy setting, with royal intrigue, doomed lovers, and power struggles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4573274-fft_tic_mediakit_11.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573274" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4573274-fft_tic_mediakit_11.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573274"><img alt="The State of the Realm timeline in Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1585/15855271/4573274-fft_tic_mediakit_11.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4573274-fft_tic_mediakit_11.png 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1585/15855271/4573274-fft_tic_mediakit_11.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1585/15855271/4573274-fft_tic_mediakit_11.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a><figcaption>The State of the Realm timeline in Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">It is a lot to keep track of, but Ivalice Chronicles has a few new tools for those who really want to dig into the details of the story and its sometimes tangled royal machinations. For starters, an evolving encyclopedia is included as a quick reference of people and locations. A menu for "Auracite," magical stones that become a key plot element, shows not only the known stones but who is in possession of them at any point in the story. And my personal favorite, a State of the Realm chronicle, shows a timeline of major events laid against a map of Ivalice, which you can browse through to see where and why major characters and their armies have moved throughout the story.</p><p dir="ltr">The movements of armies are approximated by your tactical battles, which are smaller in scope than the grand story would suggest. Usually you\'re limited to four or five party members, often with one or two guest characters in tow performing their own automated actions, against an opposing force that is around eight to 10 units. Battles take place on small 3D planes where elevation can provide advantages and elements like deep water can limit your movement. With such small-scale battles, positioning each unit and specifying which direction they face at the end of the turn becomes vitally important. It also features a slightly generous form of permadeath, as downed units can be revived within three turns before they\'re gone forever. You can always recruit new units in cities, but given the grinding needed to upgrade your characters and outfit them with a number of different skills, it hurts to lose a soldier permanently, and even worse if it\'s one of your powerful named characters. Thankfully, Ivalice Chronicles has frequent auto-saves, so it\'s easy enough to find a recent spot before a doomed mission.</p><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy Tactics was and remains a grind-heavy game, even with the rebalancing of Ivalice Chronicles making it slightly less so. That\'s partly because of the Job Class system--Tactics is the earliest example of the system in the Final Fantasy series for many fans, unless they happened to import the then-Japan-only Final Fantasy 5. There are 20 standard Jobs for your units, alongside special Jobs held by named characters such as Ramza. Each Job has its own set of skills that can be purchased with Job Points (JP) earned during battles, but it wouldn\'t be quite accurate to call them skill trees, since the skills can be purchased in any order. If you just want to save up all your JP for the priciest skill, you can do that.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of the later jobs have prerequisites from earlier ones--you need to reach a certain proficiency with a Black Mage before you can become a Time Mage, for example. When you multiply all those jobs by several characters, even if you stick with a core group of eight or so, it can get demanding. There are power-leveling strategies from the original version that still work, but having a high-level party can still be a commitment. There\'s a fast-forward feature to speed up battles, but there are no experience points or JP multipliers like we saw added to the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters.</p><figure data-align="center"

much more satisfying. The best part of any class-based combat system is experimenting with different combinations, and few do it nearly as well as Final Fantasy Tactics. The flexibility of setting a main class alongside secondary abilities, passive abilities, and movement abilities--with hardly any restrictions--makes it feel very rewarding to tinker with different builds and find combinations that almost feel like cheating.</p><p dir="ltr">The difficulty of raising up an army in the early game accentuates somewhat odd balance later on, though. You spend the first three chapters dutifully grinding to build a force with hardly any special units and then, in the last chapter, you suddenly get access to lots of strong, named characters with great special abilities and stats that outdo your basic units. It\'s one rare aspect that feels mildly wonky by today\'s standards for tactical RPGs, which reinforces this game\'s place as a museum piece for an earlier age in the genre.</p><p dir="ltr">On that point, Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles largely excels. This is hands-down the best way to play this classic of the genre, thanks to a wide array of improvements. I\'ve already praised the retouched translation and excellent voice acting, along with new tools to track the story and some rebalancing. The new difficulty levels are a nice new feature as well, letting you dial back the challenge if you want an easier time through the story or would prefer to ramp up the difficulty to really test your tactical prowess. The music remains as good as ever, and since starting the remake I\'ve been idly humming battle tunes to myself.</p><p dir="ltr">The Ivalice Chronicles version also includes subtle visual updates, making the beautiful sprite artwork of the originals stand out. There\'s something homey and comforting about this visual style, with its squat figurine-like characters, and those get a chance to shine in the visual update. The world map looks clearer and more detailed than you remember, and even the relatively simple polygonal battlefields have a nice dash of retro personality.</p><p dir="ltr">The one drawback are the character portraits, which are blown up in the same style as the sprites, but don\'t look nearly as good for it due to some odd artifacting and jagged edges. Those portraits were captured from original hand-drawn artwork, so it may have been a nicer archival approach to rescan the artwork at a higher resolution, if Square Enix still has it in its archives.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4573289-fft_tic_mediakit_01.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573289" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4573289-fft_tic_mediakit_01.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573289"><img alt="Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1585/15855271/4573289-fft_tic_mediakit_01.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4573289-fft_tic_mediakit_01.png 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1585/15855271/4573289-fft_tic_mediakit_01.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1585/15855271/4573289-fft_tic_mediakit_01.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">And on that note of preserving history, this excellent version of FFT is just shy of being a definitive edition. While it\'s nice that the game offers both the "enhanced" Ivalice Chronicles version alongside a "classic" option, both versions still use the War of the Lions translation from the PSP version, so there is no option to see the original translation if you wish. And both Ivalice Chronicles options lack two special job classes added to the War of the Lions version, Onion Knight and Dark Knight. The community is sharply divided on whether these two classes are any good, naturally, but it still would have been nice to include them and make this a truly definitive package.</p><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy Tactics is a formative game in the tactical RPG genre, and still one of the greatest. Its unforgettable story has never been better told thanks to a retouched translation, stellar voice acting, and smart new tools to help track all of the palace intrigue. Combat remains incredibly rewarding and flexible, which is an especially impressive achievement given its smaller scale compared to many modern action RPGs. The Ivalice Chronicles lacks a few nice-to-have features, but it\'s easily the best way to play this all-time classic.</p>',

      body: '<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight/" data-ref-id="5000-448603">Hollow Knight</a> is a venture into Hallownest\'s depths, a methodical descent ever deeper into the quiet stillness of a long-dead kingdom in a desperate attempt to understand why this civilization fell, what possesses only some of its bug citizens to revert into unthinking and violent insects and not others, and what it is we\'re even doing there. There are no concrete answers to be found or a set path to follow; there\'s barely a discernible objective for almost the entire game. It is a story built around curiosity, only rewarding snippets of Hallownest\'s fascinating history to those who venture for no other reason than wanting to do so. It\'s one of my favorite games of all time, and its sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Sil</a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">ksong</a>, is even better.</p><p dir="ltr">In some ways, you can tell that Silksong started out as an expansion to the first game. It plays largely the same, and long-time fans will fall into the familiar rhythm of pogoing off enemy heads and deadly saw blades with downward slashes, frantically healing during brief breaks in an intense boss fight, parrying an attack with a well-timed slash, and breathing a sigh of relief upon reaching the next bench and setting a new spawn point.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573812-silk1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573812" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573812-silk1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573812"><img alt="Hornet\'s journey starts at the bottom of Pharloom." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4573812-silk1.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573812-silk1.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4573812-silk1.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4573812-silk1.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a><figcaption>Hornet\'s journey starts at the bottom of Pharloom.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">It\'s not all exactly the same: Hornet\'s downward slash is initially her trademark diagonal dive (but you can change it later!), for example. But Silksong <em>feels </em>like more Hollow Knight. The rhythmic acrobatic nature of combat, rewarding feeling of success from defeating a tough-as-nails boss, and sense of wonder at discovering that there is, in fact, another area to explore are all here. Team Cherry created a superb gameplay loop in the first game, and that fantastic formula continues to shine in Silksong years later.</p><p dir="ltr">Silksong brings focus to this loop, however. While a lot of people (myself included) really liked how the first game encouraged you to enjoy being lost and finding wonder in the unexpected beauty of a haunted but colorful world, plenty of folks wanted more traditional structure, and Silksong provides that. Every main objective has a waypoint, hub areas advertise optional side quests on glimmering quest boards, and an in-game menu keeps track of every quest you have and where to go to start or continue it. In terms of navigation, it\'s far easier to get to the end of Silksong than Hollow Knight. You always have a clear idea of the direction you need to be going, so the flow of progression is consistent from start to finish.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573813-silk4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573813" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573813-silk4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573813"><img alt="Pharloom is a tad more industrialized than Hallownest." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4573813-silk4.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573813-silk4.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4573813-silk4.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4573813-silk4.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a><figcaption>Pharloom is a tad more industrialized than Hallownest.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">Hornet is far more nimble than the first game\'s unnamed vessel as well. She can grab and pull herself up ledges and heal in midair, for instance. And while she gains the traversal abilities that the vessel did, like a double-jump and wall jump, she gets a whole lot more, like sprinting, a grappling hook, and gliding. The platforming challenges are subsequently not as unforgiving as those in Hollow Knight--Silksong makes running and jumping far more fun and fulfilling. Hornet has more moves that she can perform in midair to reorient herself and potentially save a bad jump, and there are more safe spaces and spots to heal between platforming gauntlets. It\'s still not easy. But a mistimed button press is less likely to frustratingly set you back five minutes and cause you to contemplate throwing your Switch across the room. Breathe easy; Silksong doesn\'t yet have anything on par with the Path of Pain. (And this is not me advocating for you to add one in an expansion, Team Cherry! I enjoy being happy.)</p><p dir="ltr">Much like mission structure and traversal mechanics, combat is better too. Because Hornet is faster and possesses far more options when it comes to dealing damage, enemies are subsequently stronger. Silksong\'s combat tempo is quite fast once you get out of the starting areas, and only gets faster as you venture further. But the game does an excellent job of easing you into this challenge, introducing new enemy types piecemeal so that you\'re not overwhelmed. There\'s still an element of strategic back-and-forth, but there\'s less waiting and hiding in Silksong. Hornet feels like a deadly hunter with her speed and power, and you\'re incentivized to be precise in your aggression--she cannot take many hits, but you need to get in the fray and land some hits of your own to build up the necessary silk to unleash her hardest-hitting skills and heal.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573814-silk2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573814" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573814-silk2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573814"><img alt="Lace feels like a mirror of Hornet, making for one of the most enjoyable early-game fights." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4573814-silk2.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573814-silk2.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4573814-silk2.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4573814-silk2.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a><figcaption>Lace feels like a mirror of Hornet, making for one of the most enjoyable early-game fights.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">Fights often feel like a series of dances (especially against the more humanoid bosses, as their fights emulate fencing-like duels), with the excellent musical score that accompanies each major battle providing a baseline for the speed at which you should be moving to keep up with what you\'re fighting.</p><p dir="ltr">Nothing in Silksong feels unfair (so far at least--I haven\'t yet completed all of Act III), though certain boss fights approach that feeling of frustration with how difficult their challenge is to overcome. The game is certainly more unforgiving than Hollow Knight when it comes to defeating a boss--rarely does a loss put you right back into the action to try again. Fewer benches and larger areas mean each respawn typically includes an eventful trek back to where you last died, with environmental hazards and minor enemies potentially chipping away at Hornet\'s health long before you\'ve returned to the boss arena. And the bosses themselves tend to hit a lot harder than the ones found in the first game, taking two chunks of Hornet\'s health rather than only one.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573815-silk7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573815" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1200px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573815-silk7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573815"><img alt="I\'m sure they\'re fine." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573815-silk7.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573815-silk7.jpg 1200w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4573815-silk7.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" data-width="1200"></a><figcaption>I\'m sure they\'re fine.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">But there are optional crests, charms, and tools that, if found and equipped, can alleviate that challenge. The fire-spewing Father of the Flame is far more approachable with the Magma Bell charm equipped for example, which halves the damage taken from fire attacks. And the cackling Sister Splinter is tricky if you just keep throwing yourself at her and her annoying summons, but the Reaper crest lets Hornet more easily pogo jump off of the flying summons, stunning them. This crest also nets you silk far more quickly so you can keep healing--throw in the Guarding Bell charm (which can reflect any attack while Hornet heals) and you have a surefire way of sending Sister Splinter\'s hardest-hitting attacks right back at her, potentially stunning her for some easy hits.</p><p dir="ltr">Nothing in Silksong informs you that you should be actively searching for new crests, charms, and tools so that you can piece together different builds, unfortunately. This can make several bosses extremely irritating to take on, especially if you\'re not a fan of letting your curiosity take you off the highlighted path and you\'d prefer beating enemies with your favorite loadout.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573816-silk3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573816" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573816-silk3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573816"><img alt="Bellhome is one of my favorite areas in Pharloom." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4573816-silk3.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573816-silk3.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4573816-silk3.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4573816-silk3.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a><figcaption>Bellhome is one of my favorite areas in Pharloom.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">The two most frustrating early game examples of this--Moorwing and the aforementioned Sister Splinter--have been adjusted with post-launch updates, so this qualm may be squashed. I can\'t speak to what it\'s like to face them now having beaten them long before that patch dropped.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest improvement Silksong has over its predecessor is its hero. We first met Hornet in the original Hollow Knight. A warrior princess born of one queen, taught to fight by a second, and raised by a third, Hornet is one of the fiercest bosses you face on your journey, but also the only ally you have who clues you in that a great and terrifying secret lies at the furthest depths of Hallownest, a truth hidden away long ago by the king who failed to protect his people from a pandemic. With her help and guidance, you can prove a more worthy hero than the arrogant king who tried and failed to save himself, uncovering and facing the source of the infection that now grips Hallownest.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573817-silk6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573817" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573817-silk6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573817"><img alt="Like the vessel in the first game, Hornet can help out friendly bugs found throughout Silksong." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4573817-silk6.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573817-silk6.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4573817-silk6.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4573817-silk6.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a><figcaption>Like the vessel in the first game, Hornet can help out friendly bugs found throughout Silksong.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">A huge part of Hollow Knight is the slow realization that Hornet should be Hallownest\'s savior. She has the knowledge, battle prowess, and royal obligation of three queens behind her, the blood of a god flowing through her, and is presumably the last descendant of a once-great tribe of spider mages who could weave together powerful magic; her qualifications far outpace the unnamed and meager vessel that the player controls. But she can\'t be the one who saves Hallownest because she\'s a person with a mind, a will, and a voice. She was loved and raised, and thus cannot ever be a true hollow knight. The aspects that make her special make her a liability to the home that needs her.</p><p dir="ltr">Silksong gives Hornet an opportunity to use her upbringing in a place where it can have a more positive effect. Captured and taken to the kingdom of Pharloom, Hornet escapes from her keepers but unintentionally falls to the near bottom, and freedom is only possible if she deals with whoever captured her in the first place. So unlike the first game\'s unnamed vessel, Hornet\'s quest sees her climbing upward, not going downward.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573818-09_volt.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573818" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 2560px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573818-09_volt.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573818"><img alt="Silksong may have no Path of Pain, but there are still plenty of platforming challenges." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4573818-09_volt.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573818-09_volt.png 2560w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4573818-09_volt.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4573818-09_volt.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a><figcaption>Silksong may have no Path of Pain, but there are still plenty of platforming challenges.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">It is a journey that the vessel could have potentially completed, but one that Hornet--a being with a mind, will, and voice--is far more qualified to do, as her independent thinking, leadership, and uncompromising morals inspire those around her to follow her and try to rise up too. In some cases, they literally follow her upwards through Pharloom, while in others it\'s a more figurative ascent: reaching toward a better way of life, finding a purpose to climb out of despair, or rising above communal suffering to be a good person who selflessly helps, not selfishly takes advantage. Whereas Hallownest needed a solitary pariah to sacrifice itself so the kingdom could start over, Pharloom needs a warrior princess to salvage its most important pieces, the people, and bring them together into something better.</p><p dir="ltr">It\'s a story aided by an understanding of Hornet\'s history during the events of Hollow Knight, though still profoundly enjoyable on its own merits. Silksong\'s reintroduction of the Weavers, a supposedly long-dead tribe of wizard spiders, delves into Hornet\'s heritage, providing the warrior princess with greater incentive to explore Pharloom and giving the player a more personable protagonist to embody. So much of this part of Hornet\'s story, her reclamation of her heritage and the ramifications it will have for her and Pharloom, is squirreled away in optional side quests, similar to the vessel\'s connection to the Void in the first game. And thanks to Silksong\'s more structured handling of quests, it\'s far easier to notice and engage with this hidden side of the narrative and reach Act III. Again, I still haven\'t finished this part of the game, but the writing and music and visuals of what I\'ve experienced so far have transformed not only how I think about the first two acts of Silksong, but Hornet\'s role across the series.  </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573819-silk5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573819" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573819-silk5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573819"><img alt="Hornet is fast and deadly, making her exceptionally capable at taking on multiple foes at once." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4573819-silk5.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4573819-silk5.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4573819-silk5.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/4573819-silk5.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a><figcaption>Hornet is fast and deadly, making her exceptionally capable at taking on multiple foes at once.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">There\'s so much to love about Hollow Knight: Silksong, especially if you were a fan of the first game. This sequel better focuses the narrative with guided exploration and eases the frustrations with the first game\'s platforming by making the protagonist far more acrobatic. In many respects, that makes it a safe sequel, as much of the game is merely a more polished, approachable, and fulfilling take on what worked well before. But that first game is one of the best metroidvania titles out there, making this sequel equally essential. Hornet\'s story is more than worth the wait.</p>',

      body: '<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blippo-plus/" data-ref-id="5000-654404">Blippo+</a> is certainly one of the strangest games you could play this year--or any year, really. Released on Steam, Switch, and <a href="https://play.date/" rel="nofollow ">Playdate</a> (the small yellow handheld famous for its crank controls), it strains the fundamental definition of a video game. Instead, it\'s more of a simulation of TV channel-surfing in the late \'80s or early \'90s, a kind of interaction younger generations actually have no experience with. It\'s a game whose target audience would seem to be very few people at all. And yet, because I enjoy exceptionally weird experiences, it delivers.</p><p dir="ltr">Blippo+ is a collection of live-action skits meant to play like a cable television package from 30ish years ago. When you first start up the game, it "scans" for channels--a process I vaguely recalled interacting with as a kid when Blippo+ reminded me. Then, once its dozen or so channels are found, you simply... watch TV.</p><p dir="ltr">The TV schedule plays out in real time. These are not on-demand offerings a la Netflix or HBO Max. This is a perpetually cycling programming schedule. If you tune into the news channel, for example, you\'ll miss what\'s happening at the same time on the music, family or--yes--even the porn channel. Each program only lasts a few minutes, so it\'s not as though you\'re locked in for 30 or more minutes if you want to watch any single program in its entirety. This also makes it easy enough to eventually catch everything, either by channel-surfing routinely like a kid after school in 1996, or by sticking with one channel at a time until it has looped fully, then moving onto the next channel.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4572707-3323850_1497.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4572707" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 2560px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4572707-3323850_1497.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4572707"><img alt="Every show becomes a micro-story you can follow for several in-game weeks at a time." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4572707-3323850_1497.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4572707-3323850_1497.jpg 2560w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4572707-3323850_1497.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1632/16320660/4572707-3323850_1497.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a><figcaption>Every show becomes a micro-story you can follow for several in-game weeks at a time.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">The story of Blippo+ is that you, the player, have tuned into TV signals from an alien world called Blip. Its inhabitants look like us, only with a fashion sense that colorfully combines Clinton-era garb with makeup and hairdos that feel noticeably extraterrestrial.</p><p dir="ltr">Its TV shows are similarly out of this world. Cooking shows walk you through how to prepare vegetables that don\'t exist on Earth. A woman with a literal third eye hosts a mystical, horoscope-focused show. Most interestingly, early news programs in the show\'s many hours of programming discuss the revelation that some tens of thousands of PeeDees (the ubiquitous smartphone-like devices on planet Blip) have been activated elsewhere in the universe. Essentially, you play the role of interloper, rubber-necking at another world whose signals you\'ve inadvertently picked up.</p><p dir="ltr">This concept would likely work best on the Playdate, the already-strange device that releases games on a weekly schedule, giving its players a schedule to opt into and discuss on Reddit, YouTube, and Discord. Canonically, the Playdate itself is the PeeDee device that everyone on Blip owns and lives by. I didn\'t get to play it on that platform, but I found Blippo+ achieves its main goal on Steam too, especially since I played it with a controller and let myself feel like I really was channel-surfing, like maybe you did in the old days.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the coolest aspects of Blippo+ is its TV Guide-like channel. At the risk of sounding like an old man, back in my day, you\'d watch the TV Guide channel to see what\'s on now and what\'s coming on later. You\'d then have to make yourself available for whatever interested you. Blippo\'s guide channel amusingly captures this defunct experience, with filler music and narration filling in the space as the programs unfold with or without you tuning into them. No matter what you\'re watching, it\'s also filtered with that peak drabness of the 1990s, pre-HD and noticeably drained of color.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4572708-3323850_1495.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4572708" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 2560px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4572708-3323850_1495.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4572708"><img alt="The cooking shows had an oddly unsettling effect, as I watched these alien crops be prepared for dishes." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4572708-3323850_1495.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4572708-3323850_1495.jpg 2560w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4572708-3323850_1495.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1632/16320660/4572708-3323850_1495.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a><figcaption>The cooking shows had an oddly unsettling effect, as I watched these alien crops be prepared for dishes.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">On Playdate, new content for Blippo+ has dropped every Thursday to flesh out the game\'s overarching storyline, in which different programs call back to one another. Meanwhile, the residents of Blip grapple with the existence of otherworldly voyeurs such as yourself, which becomes appointment television, a meta-serial about other planets and the weirdos who live there.</p><p dir="ltr">On Steam and Switch, those content drops are instead unlocked as you watch more of the shows. Roughly every 30-40 minutes in my several hours with the game, I\'d get a notification that more content was available. It\'s handled this way because Playdate devotees have been unraveling the weekly Blippo+ drops for months now, whereas those on traditional PC and console are playing catch-up. This hinders the communal aspect of Blippo+, which I find appealing, but that\'s not to say the project falls apart without this piece intact.</p><p dir="ltr">Blippo+ is a game by and for Theater Kids most of all, though I enjoyed my time with it despite not being one myself. Each skit has a dry humor and an undercurrent of adoration for acting and the arts that will absolutely be alienating--no pun intended--for some players. Even some of those who like the idea of simulating this quintessential \'90s experience of couch-potatoing away your Saturday with Blippo\'s soap operas and music videos may find that these skits don\'t quite fulfill the fantasy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4572709-3323850_1498.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4572709" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 2560px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4572709-3323850_1498.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4572709"><img alt="Scrolling the TV Guide-like channel is either going to be nostalgic... or appropriately alien." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4572709-3323850_1498.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4572709-3323850_1498.jpg 2560w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4572709-3323850_1498.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1632/16320660/4572709-3323850_1498.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a><figcaption>Scrolling the TV Guide-like channel is either going to be nostalgic... or appropriately alien.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">That\'s because, for as great a job as Blippo+ does at actually simulating the physical element of half-mindedly flipping channels like a kid procrastinating on their homework, the many shows developed for Blippo+ ultimately feel too similar in tone. They\'re <em>all</em> going for a dry, silly weirdness. In my eight or so hours with Blippo+, I didn\'t see anything that took itself too seriously. Maybe it wouldn\'t have worked, or the creators just weren\'t interested in that side of its imaginary people. Or maybe that\'s their way of saying planet Blip really is just a bunch of one-note dweebs who never take things too seriously.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, I most appreciated Blippo+ for its indirect parodies of TV shows from our world. A Bill Nye-like scientist spent his shows interviewing guests like a brain in a jar, who was said to be one of Blip\'s most famous philosophers. I could read reviews about a series called "Werf\'s Tavern," which spoofs something like a Doctor Who, right down to the poorly aged depictions of some would-be harmful stereotypes. The pornography channel, Zest, comically captures the formative \'90s experience of trying to de-scramble the imagery while saxophones cut through the static. One of my favorite series, Realms Beyond, tells spooky anthological stories a la The Twilight Zone, but does so via spoken word, making it more like a radio show than Serling\'s seminal sci-fi series.</p><p dir="ltr">Blippo+ rarely parodies any specific series and is instead more interested in capturing certain vibes or subgeneres--stitchings of moments in time from yesteryear. Like on my home planet, Blip\'s programming isn\'t all worth watching, but there are some gems on rotation for those who care to make a lazy weekend out of it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4572710-3323850_1506.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4572710" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 2560px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4572710-3323850_1506.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4572710"><img alt="Like my older brother in 1996, you can try your best to de-scramble the porn channel." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4572710-3323850_1506.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4572710-3323850_1506.jpg 2560w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4572710-3323850_1506.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1632/16320660/4572710-3323850_1506.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a><figcaption>Like my older brother in 1996, you can try your best to de-scramble the porn channel.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">Blippo+ feels like an art school project that broke containment and went international. What the team has done with a seemingly shoestring budget makes for a laudable DIY effort. Calling this a game could mislead some users, given it\'s really more like a \'90s-colored cable TV package without any on-demand features. It\'s interactive, yes, but only in the way one\'s TV was in the mid-\'90s. This sort of experience is sure to be unlike anything else you\'ve ever played--and for younger players, anything they\'ve even experienced in the first place--though a significant number of people will surely come out of it more confused than amused. Still, if you can match Blippo\'s vibe, you may find yourself homesick for another world.</p>',

Or perhaps more aptly, it never leaves you.</p><p dir="ltr">The same can be said for Silent Hill f itself. Although the game distances itself from previous entries in the series--most notably by trading in its Lynchian-meets-Boschian ambience and small-town America setting in favor of slow-burning Japanese horror and the humid foothills of Honshu--its overall experience is every bit as memorable as those offered by its predecessors. And yet Silent Hill f is not merely a somewhat-divergent continuation of a beloved series; it\'s an evolution, offering several gameplay improvements while also paving a new path forward. With its brilliant writing, well-designed and strategic gameplay, engaging combat, and spectacular visuals, Silent Hill f firmly establishes itself as a phenomenal work of psychological horror and among the best entries in the Silent Hill series.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Silent Hill f\'s setting is, to be cliche, very nearly a character in itself, at the center of the game\'s story is Shimizu Hinako, a young high school student who is violently thrust into a disturbing version of her hometown. In the game\'s opening moments, it\'s made clear that Hinako\'s relationships are rife with tension. As a young woman growing up during the late 1960s, much of this tension stems from her resistance towards being a "proper" young woman, much to her parents\' dismay. In her journal, she writes that her father is the very definition of a patriarchal husband--demanding, severe, and domineering--while her mother is passive to the point of cowardice. For a long time, Hinako\'s older sister, Junko, was the only person she could rely on for companionship and protection. This changed, however, once she got married and left home, leaving Hinako alone and drowning in resentment.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4571360-silent_hill_f-164761376-large.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571360" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4571360-silent_hill_f-164761376-large.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571360"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4571360-silent_hill_f-164761376-large.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4571360-silent_hill_f-164761376-large.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4571360-silent_hill_f-164761376-large.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1639/16394322/4571360-silent_hill_f-164761376-large.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a></figure><p dir="ltr">The events of Silent Hill f kick off shortly after yet another fight at home. Following the argument, Hinako leaves to find someone--anyone--whom she can talk to. As she makes her way through the eerily quiet Ebisugaoka, we are introduced to her three closest friends: Sakuko, Rinko, and Shu. In typical teenage fashion, Hinako\'s relationships with these three have an underlying sense of unease, though it\'s not immediately clear why. And yet, teenage drama quickly becomes the least of her concerns once a fog-shrouded monster begins to hunt her down, leaving flesh-devouring spider lilies, chrysanthemums, and red streams of rot in its wake.</p><p dir="ltr">Hinako is forced to then navigate the narrow alleyways and abandoned buildings of Ebisugaoka as she attempts to avoid the infestation and the grotesque creatures who accompany it. And yet, this is only half of the harrowing experience Hinako endures. At certain points throughout the game, Hinako is thrust into a spirit realm, in which a disarming young man referred to as Fox Mask guides her through strange temples and dark trials.</p><p dir="ltr">Though this premise is plenty peculiar, Silent Hill f is in some ways a bit more straightforward than previous Silent Hill titles. Well… at first, anyway. At the very least, it\'s not quite as uncanny. Rather than stumbling into suffering strangers who speak in riddles, SHF uses those closest to Hinako to heighten intrigue and tension--to alarm and unease. Whereas previous Silent Hill games always felt a bit like David Lynch\'s take on a Hieronymus Bosch painting--alienating, dreamlike, and horrifying--Silent Hill f feels more like a collaboration between surrealist filmmaker Satoshi Kon and horror manga legend Junji Ito. I wouldn\'t dare to say one is better than the other, even if my personal preferences skew me towards the latter, but I will say that Silent Hill f moved, unsettled, and awed me in ways few games can.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of whether Hinako is trudging through rice fields, roaming the halls of her former middle school, or traipsing alongside Fox Mask in the spirit realm, the world of Silent Hill f is stunning and atmospheric. Though I\'ve never been to Kanayama--the real-life Japanese town that inspired Silent Hill f\'s Ebisugaoka--I was extremely impressed by the way Konami managed to replicate a rural Japanese town. I certainly won\'t claim to be an arbiter of authenticity, but as I wove through alleys and watched concrete and chainlink give way to worn-wood homes and dampened dirt paths, I was reminded of the time I\'ve spent near Nagano, or south of Osaka: places where nature and culture coexist in such a surreal but beautiful way. As I moved through Ebisugaoka, I felt as though I could taste the humidity; as though I could smell the forest floor.</p><p dir="ltr">The spirit realm, on the other hand, feels appropriately unknowable--steeped in history and reverence. When you walk through its temple halls, it feels as if the world <em>should</em> be eerily quiet, ultimately making the rattling chains of four-legged enemies, chattering of dolls, and Akira Yamaoka\'s phenomenal compositions all the more impactful. Yes, composer Yamaoka returns for Silent Hill f, and while he naturally retains his ability to build tension at the drop of a hat, Silent Hill f also might just show off how beautiful and consuming his work can be, too. I was impressed by how he makes SHF sound like a Silent Hill game while also giving it its own identity and celebrating its new setting, placing traditional Japanese instrumentation, guttural singing, and haunting choirs alongside his signature industrial sound.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4571362-silent_hill_f-991606882-large.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571362" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4571362-silent_hill_f-991606882-large.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571362"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4571362-silent_hill_f-991606882-large.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4571362-silent_hill_f-991606882-large.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4571362-silent_hill_f-991606882-large.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1639/16394322/4571362-silent_hill_f-991606882-large.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a></figure><p dir="ltr">Yet fidelity and sound aren\'t all that contribute to how artistically profound Silent Hill f is. Among the more crucial elements are the game\'s haunting visuals and nightmarish creatures, both of which disturb as much as they fascinate, and accomplish the game\'s mission of exploring the space where the gorgeous and grotesque meet. Boss designs are consistently remarkable, drawing upon traditional Japanese attire, weaponry, and folklore to elevate them, while your standard enemies--from hewn mannequins to feminine monstrosities whose bodies are covered in pulsing, pregnant bellies--are every bit as unsettling. Expect to see flesh fall, bones snap, and plenty of viscera during your time with Silent Hill f, as well as cinematic cutscenes that feel utterly otherworldly.</p><p dir="ltr">More important than being both visually and audibly remarkable, however, is how Silent Hill f\'s locations serve the game\'s narrative and themes. Prior to Silent Hill f\'s release, Konami stated that Silent Hill should be viewed as a state of mind rather than a physical location, hence why some games in the series--including SHF--don\'t take place in the East Coast-inspired town. That said, if we are to view the locations these protagonists explore as metaphors for the human psyche, I can\'t imagine a more suitable world than the one crafted here.</p><p dir="ltr">Ebisugaoka\'s alleys cut through the town like neural pathways--twisting, turning, connecting, and coming to abrupt ends. Both the town and the spirit realm disorient just as much as they dazzle, heightening this sense of confusion and loss. They also revel in contradiction. Throughout the game, we witness gorgeous grotesquery as flowers and gore consume the town in equal measure; we stumble across sacred places that feel utterly profane, and watch as the supernatural and otherworldly collide with the lush and natural. Much like Hinako and Silent Hill f itself, this world is not meant to be entirely understood.</p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, this sense of mystery also heightens one of the Silent Hill series\' most notable features: its puzzles. Throughout Silent Hill f, there are roughly a dozen puzzles to solve, with a particularly important one sprawling across the entire game and requiring at least one playthrough to be completed before you can start it. Others are more straightforward, and task you with things like deciphering a coded language, finding and correctly placing medallions, or navigating complex hallways by pulling levers to open and close doors.</p><p dir="ltr">By and large, these are all engaging and just the right level of difficulty on the game\'s Hard mode, its default puzzle difficulty. After completing the game once, you\'ll also gain Lost in the Fog difficulty, which adds a bit more of a challenge, though I didn\'t find it to be too extraordinary a jump. That said, one or two of these puzzles stand out as far less enjoyable (and more convoluted) than the others, ultimately dragging on a bit too long for my liking and resulting in my facing off against a grating number of enemies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4571364-4542105-ss_0052fc9d54c4b4f1588b798a6638556c6b5d4db2.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571364" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4571364-4542105-ss_0052fc9d54c4b4f1588b798a6638556c6b5d4db2.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571364"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4571364-4542105-ss_0052fc9d54c4b4f1588b798a6638556c6b5d4db2.1920x1080.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4571364-4542105-ss_0052fc9d54c4b4f1588b798a6638556c6b5d4db2.1920x1080.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4571364-4542105-ss_0052fc9d54c4b4f1588b798a6638556c6b5d4db2.1920x1080.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1639/16394322/4571364-4542105-ss_0052fc9d54c4b4f1588b798a6638556c6b5d4db2.1920x1080.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a></figure><p dir="ltr">Fortunately, Silent Hill f alleviates some of the annoyance these moments stir up with remarkably fun close-quarters combat. Compared to previous entries in the series, Silent Hill f is more action-oriented, relying on executing perfect dodges and parrying at the correct time to dish out damage to enemies. Though the studio has shied away from comparisons to soulslikes, there is an undeniably familiar feeling as you bounce back and forth between light- and heavy-attacks before quickly dodging out of harm\'s way. And whereas some horror games stumble when they lean too far into action, Silent Hill f manages to do so to great success, creating a fluid and engaging system that enhances the game rather than detracts from it.</p><p dir="ltr">That said, it\'s not perfect. At times, I felt enemies were not quite as responsive to my attacks as I wished and lacked proper feedback. Other times, I found myself a bit frustrated by how the game\'s tight corridors, quickly depleting stamina bar, and imperfect controls created situations where I was unable to do anything as an enemy continuously wailed on me. This didn\'t happen too often, though, and considering horror games aren\'t known for having particularly jaw-dropping combat, I didn\'t mind those few moments of unreliability and overwhelm. In some regards, it served as a reminder that Hinako is just a high school girl, not a military-trained operative you might find in Resident Evil 3\'s Raccoon City.</p><p dir="ltr">And while combat is more fluid than ever, this doesn\'t necessarily mean it\'s easy or that you should engage with every enemy you encounter. Keeping in line with former Silent Hill games, there is no real incentive for you to take on enemies you\'re not required to kill to progress--no items are dropped, and no experience is given. In fact, choosing to do so can come at a detriment, as combat can be quite challenging and will always cost you more resources than you net, including your weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">Yes, in addition to your health, stamina, and sanity, you\'ll want to pay attention to your weapon\'s durability as you play, as weapon degradation is back. While this might sound like a lot to monitor, in execution it works extremely well, and greatly heightens the stakes and sense that Hinako\'s survival must be won.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to weapon degradation, Silent Hill f\'s permanent-upgrade system also adds another layer of strategy and resource management. Throughout Ebisugaoka and the spirit realm are shrines Hinako can visit to enshrine select objects, including some of those used to heal or regenerate sanity and stamina. Enshrining an object converts it into Faith, which can then be used to draw an omamori--a talisman granting Hinako a random boon--or to permanently upgrade one of her stats. This adds an interesting element of choice, as you must consider whether you should hang on to your various healing items to use in battle or convert them into faith for permanent upgrades.</p><p dir="ltr">Trading in your items for upgrades is made even more tempting by the fact that both Hinako\'s stat upgrades and omamoris carry over to New Game Plus, greatly heightening their usefulness and making subsequent playthroughs easier. And while you might not typically be the type to replay a game on New Game Plus, Silent Hill f makes an extremely compelling case to reconsider your stance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4571363-silent-hill-f-is-back-with-a-trailer-and-brand-new-images-cover67d35b74a7d13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571363" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4571363-silent-hill-f-is-back-with-a-trailer-and-brand-new-images-cover67d35b74a7d13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571363"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4571363-silent-hill-f-is-back-with-a-trailer-and-brand-new-images-cover67d35b74a7d13.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4571363-silent-hill-f-is-back-with-a-trailer-and-brand-new-images-cover67d35b74a7d13.jpg 1920w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4571363-silent-hill-f-is-back-with-a-trailer-and-brand-new-images-cover67d35b74a7d13.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1639/16394322/4571363-silent-hill-f-is-back-with-a-trailer-and-brand-new-images-cover67d35b74a7d13.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a></figure><p dir="ltr">Although a playthrough of Silent Hill f takes around 10 hours to complete, you\'d be remiss to call it a 10-hour-long game. Within the game there are five endings, one of which you are locked into the first time you play, and it was only after unlocking two of them that I began to feel as though I somewhat understood what was happening to Hinako and her hometown; that I began to grasp that each playthrough should not be viewed as a separate experience, but as part of a whole.</p><p dir="ltr">As such, playing through Silent Hill f multiple times feels absolutely essential to the overall experience. For those of you familiar with the game\'s writer, Ryukishi07, this might come as no surprise, as his other works are known for doing precisely this and often use their first ending to raise questions rather than answer them; Silent Hill f is no exception. Thankfully, fantastic gameplay, the ability to skip old cutscenes, plenty of new content each playthrough, and dramatically different endings--complete with different bosses--make playing through the game multiple times an exciting prospect.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet the most compelling reason to replay Silent Hill f is simply to experience every bit of its brilliant, horrifying, and, oftentimes, deeply cathartic story. Though I won\'t dive too deep into the ideas and themes of the game in order to preserve the experience for others, suffice to say I was blown away by the mastery in which Silent Hill f explores gender roles, agency, isolation, identity, relationships, and womanhood, as well as by the way it perfectly balances clarity and ambiguity to create something profound and reflective. Among AAA titles, there are few games that dare to broach the same topics developer NeoBards Entertainment does in this title--and far fewer that handle them with even close to the same amount of grace, nuance, and conviction.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps this isn\'t surprising, considering that nearly every part of Silent Hill f is crafted with the same level of care and skill. And yet, that doesn\'t make anything about this game and what NeoBards has achieved any less impressive. Silent Hill f is not just a return to form, it\'s a remarkable evolution; it\'s a visual spectacle, a mastercraft in psychological horror, a work of narrative brilliance, and a new benchmark for the Silent Hill series.</p>',

      body: '<p dir="ltr">It wouldn\'t seem to make sense to call <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dying-light-the-beast/" data-ref-id="5000-640462">Dying Light: The Beast</a> a more grounded game than its predecessors. It\'s a game in which you routinely shift into something like X-Men\'s Wolverine, slashing at the undead with the ferocity of a preying mountain lion and carving them to shreds with what is basically an instant win button. But beyond the feature that informs the game\'s title, this expansion turned standalone sequel actually leans further into horror and survival than anything in the series, making it the most fun I\'ve had with Dying Light to date.</p><p dir="ltr">Dying Light: The Beast returns the game\'s original protagonist, Kyle Crane, to the starring role, moving him to Castor Woods, a brand-new location for the series, and a lush nature reserve decorated with once-gorgeous villages that manage to feel both ornate and rustic at the same time. Like before, the game is an open-world first-person zombie game with a significant emphasis on death-defying parkour and brutal melee combat. But The Beast adds (or returns) a few other wrinkles, too.</p><p dir="ltr">For one, guns are more prevalent than ever this time, though ammo isn\'t as common. Using guns feels reliable enough but doesn\'t fill your Beast Mode meter, so I frequently rejected this quasi-new toy in favor of the series\' long-held favorites: baseball bats, machetes, and loose pipes fitted with elemental add-ons that light the zombies on fire, send electric shocks through the hordes, or cause them to bleed out between my crunchy swings to their squishy heads.</p><p dir="ltr">Melee combat is once again a highlight of the game, with heft behind every attempt to take out a zombie, and so many different weapons and modifiers to choose from. Zombies charge at you even as you take chunks out of their abdomens, chop off their legs, or leave their jaws hanging off their faces. This damage model isn\'t new to the series--Dying Light 2 added this in a patch years ago--but it remains a gruesome, eye-catching display that further illustrates the team\'s dedication to making every combat encounter memorable.</p><p dir="ltr">In The Beast, stamina is harder to manage than I ever recall, and that\'s a change I adored. It made every fight feel like one for my life. Enemies did well to scale with my character and weapons, and demanded that I frequently make stops at various safehouses to upgrade my weapons. Even my favorites wouldn\'t last forever either, with each of them having a finite number of repairs before they\'d break permanently. This differs from the series\' past way of letting you carry and upgrade your preferred skull-bashing or leg-slicing items with you at all times.</p><p dir="ltr">I distinctly recall having an easier go of things in Dying Light 2 than I did in The Beast, thanks to hero Aiden Caldwell\'s expansive list of parkour and combat abilities. Kyle isn\'t depicted as a lesser freerunner or fighter, but his skill tree is nonetheless smaller, causing him to feel more vulnerable in a way I hope the series sticks with going forward. There were many times when I\'d have to retreat in a minor panic from a small horde of basic zombies just to catch my breath. The Beast isn\'t a game where you can usually just hack up the crowd without careful consideration and stamina management.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568502-ss_8391c35e0bdb345926596a62a72711e82008087d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568502" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 3840px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568502-ss_8391c35e0bdb345926596a62a72711e82008087d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568502"><img alt="Parkouring over, around, and even onto zombies remains fun in Dying Light\'s third outing." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4568502-ss_8391c35e0bdb345926596a62a72711e82008087d.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568502-ss_8391c35e0bdb345926596a62a72711e82008087d.jpg 3840w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4568502-ss_8391c35e0bdb345926596a62a72711e82008087d.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1632/16320660/4568502-ss_8391c35e0bdb345926596a62a72711e82008087d.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a><figcaption>Parkouring over, around, and even onto zombies remains fun in Dying Light\'s third outing.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">Of course, there\'s an exception to that rule: When you build up your Beast Mode bar, you earn a few seconds of near-invulnerability, as well as the ability to tear apart zombies with your bare hands and a very cool, very high leap that collectively makes you feel like a superhero. From a narrative sense, Beast Mode leans into the stuff I still don\'t enjoy about Dying Light: over-the-top action meant to fulfill a power fantasy of being the one-man killing machine in a world overrun by the undead. I love zombie fiction, but my taste in that subgenre is firmly planted in slower, spookier worlds where despair rules the day. Dying Light has never been that before, at least not consistently. Thankfully, in a gameplay sense, Beast Mode functionally serves less like a pure power fantasy and more like a get-out-of-jail-free card.</p><p dir="ltr">So many times in my 30ish hours with this game, I\'d activate Beast Mode not to further pile on a crowd of enemies I was already dispatching with ease, but as a last-ditch effort to stay alive. Techland seems to have planned for this use case, given how receiving damage, not just doling it out, fills that bar. Beast Mode isn\'t Kyle going Super Saiyan; it\'s the emergency fire extinguisher, and breaking that figurative glass amid a fight for my life is a much more enjoyable gameplay loop than some of Dying Light 2\'s absurdities.</p><p dir="ltr">Even while the story goes to some places that feel like B-horror fare--the type of thing I would fully ignore if it were a movie instead--the game remains at odds with that plot by being so tense and only giving Kyle the powers to survive, but not thrive like Aiden did. This is never clearer, nor more enjoyable, than at nighttime. One of the key pillars of this series is how the day-night cycle essentially presents two different games. When the sun is up, Kyle is empowered and capable of scraping by at the very least. But when night falls, the game\'s super-fast, super-strong Volatiles take over and shift the game into a full-blown stealth horror.</p><p dir="ltr">Movement and combat are both totally rewritten depending on the time of day. In sunlight, you\'ll scale buildings, leap across gaps, and swing on tree branches like an Assassin\'s Creed hero. But at night, every step must be carefully considered, so you\'ll end up crouching and spamming the "survivor sense" to briefly ping nearby Volatiles. When they give chase, the results are <em>intense</em>. They\'ll claw at your heels as the music spikes your heart rate. The chase will inevitably invite more Volatiles to join in, and they\'ll flank you, spew gunk to knock you off walls, and almost never relent until you finally--if you\'re so lucky--cross the threshold of a safe haven, where UV lights keep the monsters at bay.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568503-ss_f38e69c8b6d6ee4eda2016de28eb11ad3632a552.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568503" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 3840px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568503-ss_f38e69c8b6d6ee4eda2016de28eb11ad3632a552.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568503"><img alt="Nighttime is harder in The Beast than ever before, and yet that\'s also where I had the most fun." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4568503-ss_f38e69c8b6d6ee4eda2016de28eb11ad3632a552.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568503-ss_f38e69c8b6d6ee4eda2016de28eb11ad3632a552.jpg 3840w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4568503-ss_f38e69c8b6d6ee4eda2016de28eb11ad3632a552.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1632/16320660/4568503-ss_f38e69c8b6d6ee4eda2016de28eb11ad3632a552.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a><figcaption>Nighttime is harder in The Beast than ever before, and yet that\'s also where I had the most fun.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">The series\' night sequences have never been this scary before, partly because of the ample wooded areas that make up the map. I love it. Night remains an XP booster too, doubling any gains you make. In past games, I\'d use that boon to fulfill some side missions overnight. But in Dying Light: The Beast, I rarely tried to do more than make it to my nearest safe zone so I could skip time until the protective sun returned.</p><p dir="ltr">When the first game\'s expansion, The Following, set the story in a mostly-flat locale, I found it an odd choice given the game is so focused on parkour and verticality. In Dying Light: The Beast, the world designers have more wisely found ways to bring verticality to those places outside of villages, with plenty of rock walls, trees, and electricity towers to scale. One of the simple, repeatable joys I have in all of the zombie games I love is approaching a building and not knowing what I\'ll find inside. It\'s so simple that it hardly registers as a feature at all, but to me it\'s vital that a zombie game capture this specific feeling of discovery and tension. Castor Woods makes for an excellent landscape to host this repeating moment, due to its creepy cabins found all over the world. Pairing the nighttime-specific gameplay elements with a setting so unnerving gave me a sense of survival-horror unease in a way I\'ve been waiting for this series to do for a decade.</p><p dir="ltr">This leaning into horror is capped off by an incredible reinvention of the series\' theme song by Olivier Derivere. I consider Derivere to be among the very best composers in games, and the original music he poured into this game gives it so much life. The first game\'s theme always reminded me of Dawn of the Dead, with a certain layer of \'70s filth to it. Here, Derivere rethinks it with an air of 28 Days Later, getting its more modern, more haunting version stuck in my head for the past week in a way I\'ve very much invited. It sounds less like an action score and more like a horror soundtrack to my ears, matching the game\'s overall shift into something more up my particular alley.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568504-ss_6646e9be4d29779d2b0bc0e3a4a7b6b40150b208.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568504" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 3840px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:56.3%" href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568504-ss_6646e9be4d29779d2b0bc0e3a4a7b6b40150b208.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568504"><img alt="Guns are emphasized more in The Beast than ever before, but I still preferred a good, old-fashioned spiked bat." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4568504-ss_6646e9be4d29779d2b0bc0e3a4a7b6b40150b208.jpg" srcset="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568504-ss_6646e9be4d29779d2b0bc0e3a4a7b6b40150b208.jpg 3840w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4568504-ss_6646e9be4d29779d2b0bc0e3a4a7b6b40150b208.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1632/16320660/4568504-ss_6646e9be4d29779d2b0bc0e3a4a7b6b40150b208.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a><figcaption>Guns are emphasized more in The Beast than ever before, but I still preferred a good, old-fashioned spiked bat.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">It feels like this game\'s origins as a Dying Light 2 expansion helped its focus, even as it grew into a standalone semi-sequel--it\'s not yet Dying Light 3, but it\'s much more than a typical DLC. The open-world activities trim the fat from Dying Light 2\'s more Ubisoftian world. Here, you\'ll raid stores where zombies sleep, trying not to stir them. You\'ll assault broken-down military convoys for their high-tier loot locked in the back of trucks, and you can hunt down rare weapons and armor with vague treasure maps. These fun, unitedly tense activities all return from past games, but for the most part, they\'re not joined by the countless other things that have been on the map before.</p><p dir="ltr">This left me feeling like anything I did was worth my time, with the exception of some late-game racing side quests, which I didn\'t care for despite how good the trucks feel to drive. Dying Light 2 adopted some live-service elements eventually, growing into yet another game trying to be at the center of players\' solar systems, hoping to bring fans back all the time for new highlights. The Beast is a tighter, leaner 20-hour story with enough side attractions to fill in the world and your time, but doesn\'t waste it.</p><p dir="ltr">This is emblematic of Dying Light: The Beast\'s strongest quality: taking the series from an arms race against itself, constantly trying to give the player extravagant new tools, to something that is a bit dialed back, leaning into horror and tough-as-nails combat. It gives The Beast a stronger identity. There\'s no glider this time, Kyle\'s jump is a bit nerfed compared to Aiden\'s, and his parkour abilities, while many of them come already unlocked to start now, don\'t top off at the same heights as Aiden\'s. It may sound strange for a series to improve when it suddenly became withholding. Dying Light has always been a series that does a few things very well, but would get distracted trying to be a lot more at the same time. Finally, The Beast leans into Dying Light\'s best parts, giving you a scarier, tougher, more immersive world to explore than anything in the series before.</p>',

      body: '<p dir="ltr">As a dyed-in-the-wool Nintendo Kid, Mario has always been the yardstick by which I measure competitors. When Sonic the Hedgehog broke out on the Sega Genesis, I couldn\'t help but compare it to Mario\'s platforming to measure the similarities and differences. So I have to admit that it\'s difficult to approach an arcade kart racer like Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds without Mario Kart in the back of my head--especially since that series just had a new entry this summer. But it\'s that contrast that really makes CrossWorlds stand out in some positive ways. Whereas Nintendo\'s latest racer excelled due to its simplicity, CrossWorlds offers a massive wealth of options and customization to help you find and craft your own style. There is a <em>lot</em> going on, and it can be a little overwhelming, but ultimately the level of depth rewards experimentation.</p><p dir="ltr">From the start, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds offers three main offline modes, two of which need little introduction: Grand Prix and Time Trials are your tried-and-true staples, and then there\'s the more inventive Race Park. More on that in a bit. Grand Prix is where most players will start, with a suite of seven Grand Prix to master. These are listed as three races apiece, but each one also consists of a fourth grand finale race that remixes parts of the three prior tracks.</p><p dir="ltr">And that\'s where CrossWorlds gets its unique twist, as well as its name. Seemingly inspired by the Sonic the Hedgehog movies, in which rings act as portals to other planets, the tracks in Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds are not just straightforward point-A-to-point-B affairs. Instead you\'ll regularly cross a threshold through a giant ring and into a new world. The race leader chooses a destination, between one known option or another random selection. You hop into another world to visit for a little while, and then portal your way back to the main track you were in.</p><p dir="ltr">It\'s a neat trick and has the effect of making races feel unpredictable. You can\'t really sleepwalk your way through a track after memorizing every curve and bank, because before you know it you\'ll be warped to a tight-turn candyland, a bouncy mushroom forest, or an airborne stunt show. As you progress through the races, you\'ll certainly come to learn the general outlines of all the worlds you might warp to, but never knowing which one is coming feels exciting and dynamic. On a base PlayStation 5, at least, the world-changing effect is fuzzy and looks visually rough, but the impact it has on races makes up for it.</p><p dir="ltr">Adding to the variety is the transforming vehicles aspect, borrowed from Sonic All-Stars Racing: Transformed. You\'ll regularly swap between car, boat, and plane forms, and they\'ve been tweaked to make them feel noticeably different from one another. Car mode operates as you\'d expect, as a traditional kart-racer with boosts and drifts. You can also do stunts when your car catches air, and the more you do, the bigger a boost you\'ll get once you land. Plane mode gives you full vertical control, and often those segments encourage you to pull aerobatic stunts by crossing scattered boost rings. Boat mode trades the car\'s drift functionality for a charged jump, letting you leap out of the water to reach power-ups or boosts that are hovering in mid-air. This might have been the hardest for me to wrap my head around, since you need to charge to the highest level to reach the best rewards and it requires some foresight instead of the typical arcade racer instincts, but it felt that much more rewarding when I would hit it just right.</p><p dir="ltr">To me, the core racing mechanics themselves felt fairly awkward at first. Not knowing the tracks, I would frequently run into walls, and CrossWorlds punishes you with severe slowdown for doing so. It didn\'t feel great bouncing along the edges of a tight curve as the other racers passed me by, and I couldn\'t get the standard karts to cooperate with my drift-heavy style of hugging turns. Once you\'re bumping along a wall, it feels hard to course-correct. That problem was largely solved once I started leaning more towards racers and vehicles with a high Handling rating, though, so it really came down to finding a style that worked for me. The vehicles are also visually distinct, so being in a high-boost hoverboard is easily recognizable versus a hulking monster truck from a Power character, or a zippy sports cart from one of the Speed types.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6466347" data-src="/videos/sonic-racing-crossworlds-everything-to-know/2300-6466347/" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="0">          <iframe height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen id="-embed-1703667568" class="optanon-category-C0004" data-src="/videos/embed/6466347/"></iframe></div><p dir="ltr">On top of the racer and vehicle types--both of which are classified by Speed, Acceleration, Power, Handling, and Boost--there are tons of ways you can tweak both your ride and your racing style. Every base vehicle you unlock can be customized with parts you purchase with tickets, which change its stats in mostly lateral ways--a little more handling, a little less boost, for example--along with paint jobs and decals as cosmetic options. New parts cost quite a bit, so the game economy is obviously meant to sustain long-term play if you want to collect all the parts and options. The other major customization options are your gadgets, which are determined by your gear plate. Your plate upgrades as you complete more races, unlocking more slots, for up to six slots in all. Gadgets can give you a particular item at the start of the race, help you charge your drift dash more quickly, or prevent slipping on ice. There are tons of options, but in my tinkering I didn\'t find anything particularly overpowered, especially since some more powerful gadgets take up two or even three slots. But the whole system is remarkably flexible, and I was able to consistently build toward my own playstyle and experiment with new ideas. Upgrading your gear plate marks most of your progression at first, after which your reward is more gadgets.</p><p dir="ltr">This being an arcade kart racer, there are loads of items to use during a race, and they\'re not always self-explanatory. I still don\'t know if I fully grasp which Chao item has which effect. But items are by far the weakest element of the racing mechanics overall, since there are just too many items that feel like they have almost no counter. The game helpfully prompts you if you happen to be carrying one of the few items that can stop an almost-unblockable attack. But otherwise, when you see a ring hovering over your head, something is about to come out of it, and it\'s going to be bad news for you. That can make races feel frustrating, especially when you crash out inches from the finish line. To put it in Mario Kart terms, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has an overabundance of blue shells.</p><p dir="ltr">Race Park, the second main offline mode, is recommended for couch co-op or competitive multiplayer, and pits teams against each other with specialized objectives. One might challenge you to use the most offensive items against opponents while another will reward you with bonus points for using the most boost pads. You still get points for your rank in the race as usual, but these bonus objectives can make a big difference. When you rack up enough wins against a rival team, you get rewarded by unlocking their vehicle.</p><p dir="ltr">The rival element is also threaded throughout the Grand Prix races, as you\'ll be randomly assigned a Rival at the start of each set of races. You can choose to upgrade to a tougher Rival for a harder challenge, and beating your Rival gives you progress toward a meta-goal with a reward that only gets revealed after you\'ve completed all the Grand Prix races. The Rival is also generally your toughest competitor, so while you\'re racing against 11 others, beating your Rival means you\'ll usually win the race too. That has the impact of making it feel a bit too one-on-one, but it also leads to some funny interactions. At one point when my rival was Cream the Rabbit, passing her would lead to an adorable voice prompt asking, "please let me catch up!"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

There\'s a ton of visual variety, thanks in part to the courses exploring a variety of Sega-inspired worlds, and the swapping between vehicle modes means you always have to stay on your toes. The main courses seem mostly if not entirely inspired by Sonic games, spanning from the retro to the recent Sonic Frontiers. The crossworld mechanic lets you play tourist to other Sega locales and those act as fun surprises. Suddenly you\'re in Afterburner, or wait, is that a Columns reference? Even after you\'ve seen all of the tracks, it\'s fun to play spot-the-homage.</p><p dir="ltr">Online play works well enough and will likely be the mode that grants the game the most longevity. You can tweak your customized ride and gear while you wait for a match, and then players vote on a track. You progress up letter grades for matchmaking, and you can join the lobby with friends to stick together. Other than that, though, it\'s fairly no-frills. There\'s no option to match into a set of Grand Prix races or turn on optional bonus objectives like in Race Park. It works, but there\'s certainly room to grow and add more variety in the online environment.</p><p dir="ltr">Altogether, Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is a solid package. The single-player modes, meta-goals like collecting gear and vehicle parts, and wealth of customization options to experiment with different play styles, make it easy to recommend for players who like their kart racing with a little more mechanical complexity. Even with slightly underwhelming online offerings, it\'s easy to see how Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has plenty of road ahead of it.</p>',
